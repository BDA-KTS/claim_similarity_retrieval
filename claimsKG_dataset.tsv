It looks like they're going to raise taxes anywhere between 20 to 30 percent.	2007-08-06	politifact	John Martin	It's not entirely clear from the context whether Giuliani is talking about the Democratic presidential candidates or the Democrats in Congress.But it doesn't really matter, especially since so many in the Democratic field of candidates are in the Senate or the House. Either way, Giuliani is correct that Democrats are open to letting some of the tax cuts of 2001 expire, which would raise taxes for those affected.Most of the Democratic presidential candidates have said they want to renew some of the those tax cuts, which are scheduled to expire in 2010. But they also have indicated that they would favor allowing tax cuts to expire that, in their view, unfairly benefit wealthy Americans. The tax rate on household incomes above $200,000 would return to higher levels, as would taxes on capital gains, dividends and estates.But is that a 20 to 30 percent increase?To defend his claim, the Giuliani campaign points to a Congressional Budget Office report that shows a 31 percent rise in revenue from 2006 to 2011 if all of the tax cuts are allowed to expire.There are two problems with this. First of all, the Democrats aren't advocating the elimination ofallof the 2001 tax cuts. And second, the logic of the Giuliani argument is that a rise in revenues is the same as a tax increase.If that's the standard, than President Bush's own budget for 2008, released in February, includes a 29 percent tax increase over the same period, too.Nope, that doesn't cut it.

It worked. Now Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton have changed their positions to follow Chris Dodd.Dodd is correct that his fellow candidates backed an amendment he co-sponsored. And it's likely that they felt some pressure from liberal Democrats -- including Dodd -- who strongly favor withdrawal.But Dodd exaggerates his role. He is just one of nine co-sponsors of the amendment widely called the Feingold-Reid amendment, usually without Dodd's name attached. And both Clinton and Obama have advocated other troop withdrawl proposals before endorsing this one. There's no evidence that Dodd had any influence on Obama and Clinton.

In testimony and reports, military officials have said roadside bombs – improvised explosive devices – have caused 70 percent of U.S. casualties.The Commandant of the Marine Corps, Gen. James Conway, told the Joint Chiefs of Staff in a March 2007 letter the Mine Resistant Ambush Protected vehicle, called MRAPs, could reduce the casualties in vehicles due to IED attack by as much as 80 percent. Those estimates are based on damages sustained mostly by Humvees, which are commonly used for quick transport but offer little protection from bombs.The trouble with the 80 percent figure is that things are changing rapidly in Iraq. In the past year, military officials have reported that Iraqi insurgents have been using bombs that can pierce the armor of the MRAPs. The stronger bombs have been used in fewer numbers, and it's uncertain how much insurgents will target the new trucks with them, said John Pike, director of globalsecurity.org.

Not so. Here is the full assertion from Thompson's broadcast on ABC radio June 27:...study after study has shown that the death penalty deters murders. Some studies show really dramatic effects, with each execution of a murderer deterring as many as 18 or more murders. That's according to Emory University professors, who found as well that delaying execution also leads to further murders. Most studies have concluded that some number of murders between three and 18 are prevented for every application of capital punishment.A dozen research papers in the last six years support Thompson's assertion that capital punishment prevents murders, according to the Associated Press. Three studies get the most attention: a 2006 report by two economists and statistical papers in 2003 and 2006 from the Emory researchers.The Law & Order star accurately quotes the Emory study, but his generalizations about most studies ignore significant contrary research.A handful of studies directly challenge pro-deterrence findings by highlighting various missteps in methodology. These studies fail to reach the demanding standards of social science to make such strong claims, standards such as replication and basic comparisons with other scenarios, said Jeffery Fagan of the Columbia Law School during testimony before a New York legislative panel.Most notable is a paper by two National Bureau of Economic Research fellows who concluded that execution policy drives little of the year-to-year variation in homicide rates. As to whether executions rise or lower the homicide rate, we remain profoundly uncertain.

She also is correct that the automobile and airline industries are facing significant mechanic shortages. The Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates that there will be 34,000 unfilled jobs for auto mechanics and 4,000 for airline technicians each year through 2014. However, she exaggerates the pay that graduates of vocational schools can expect to earn in these professions. An auto mechanic earning $50,000 to $60,000 would be in the 90th percentile of earnings for that occupation, according to government data. The average salary for an auto technician is $32,450; for an airline mechanic it's $45,290.

The center got the number from a 2002 report by the General Accounting Office, which used U.S. Census data to estimate that 55.9-million adults did not hold checking, savings or money market accounts in 1999.But that number is at the high end of the available estimates. According to the Federal Reserve Board's 2004 Survey of Consumer Finances, its most recent, the number of American families without a bank account is closer to 10-million.

However, a quick search showed that this was a real tweet from Cheney's official and verified account, @Liz_Cheney. On Sept. 9, 2021, Cheney responded on Twitter to an endorsement from former U.S. President Donald Trump for GOP primary challenger Harriet Hageman. In Trump's endorsement, he said that Cheney was the Democrats' number one provider of sound bites. Cheney replied, Here’s a sound bite for you: Bring it. Eleven months later, Cheney lost the Wyoming primary to Hageman in a landslide, as was reflected in the bottom half of the Twitter screenshot. The screenshot was also shared in the r/AskThe_Donald subreddit on Reddit. After the primary loss, The Associated Press reported that Cheney, who also served as one of the only Republicans on the House committee investigating the Jan. 6 U.S. Capitol insurrection, was already looking ahead to a political future beyond Capitol Hill that could include a 2024 presidential run, potentially putting her on another collision course with Trump: In sum, yes, Cheney once tweeted to both Trump and Hageman to bring it, then lost her primary to the latter 11 months later.	https://www.snopes.com/ap/2022/08/17/trump-foe-cheney-loses-wyoming-gop-primary-ponders-2024-bid/:-:https://snopes.com/fact-check/rating/correct-attribution:-:https://www.snopes.com/tag/rep-liz-cheney:-:https://twitter.com/DefiantLs/status/1559964211278643200:-:https://www.google.com/search?q=fake+tweet+generator:-:https://www.reddit.com/r/AskThe_Donald/comments/wqxtgn/oh_no_no_no/:-:https://www.snopes.com/tag/reddit/:-:https://twitter.com/Liz_Cheney/status/1435985804665442307:-:https://www.snopes.com/tag/twitter/	Yes, Liz Cheney Tweeted 'Bring It,' Then Lost to Trump's Pick	['politics', 'quotes', 'reddit', 'twitter', 'rep. liz cheney', 'harriet hageman', 'president donald trump']						{'politics'}	25601	true	, , , , , , , , , , , , , politics_pred, , , , , , ,

News agencies citedsources as saying that Cheney will arrive in Amman next Friday. He will try to convince his daughter who is currently staying at a hotel in Amman not to go to Baghdad along with a group of volunteers who want to go to Iraq and form human shields against the Anglo American attacks, said the report.Origins: On 25 March 2003, the London-based Arabic daily Al Quds Al Arabi reported that the American vice president, Dick Cheney, would soon head to the Jordanian capital, Amman, to attempt to convince his daughter to back down from her decision to go to Baghdad to serve as a human shield. (The shields are civilians, usually foreigners, who place themselves around hospitals, schools and other installations in an effort to keep opposing military forces from targeting them.) Dick Cheney has two daughters: 38-year-old Mary, manager of gay and lesbian corporate relations for Coors Brewing Company, and 40-year-old Elizabeth, a deputy assistant secretary for Near-East affairs at the State Department in Washington and a mother of three. The press office of the U.S. Vice President has flatly denied the conjectures that one of the V.P.'s daughters went to Jordan to become part of the human shield against attacks on Iraq. Neither of his daughters is over there, not in Jordan, not in Iraq. Neither has any intention to travel to that area, a press office official said. The report by one of the Arab media outlets that Cheney is planning to go there and retrieve the daughter is hilarious, she added. As for a possible trip by the Vice President to Jordan, a U.S. Embassy spokesman in Amman denied Cheney was on his way to that country: The embassy has no information that the U.S. Vice President will arrive in Jordan Tuesday to convince one of his daughters not to travel to Iraq to join human shields opposed to war, he said.

Snopes readers have been emailing questions about rumors that the pop singer and performer has died, rumors that are false. But it seems that if you attain enough fame, you will eventually be the subject of a viral celebrity death hoax. Related: Why Are Online Death Hoaxes So Popular? Fears about the 76-year-old mega-celebrity's status appear to have begun circulating after a tragic event in Cher's life, namely the death of her mother in December 2022. The entertainment-focused news site HITC, for example, reported that fans became confused about the news of the passing of Cher's mother, actress and singer Georgia Holt, especially when some stumbled upon a YouTube video titled, 5 Minutes Ago / Please Keep Cher in Your Prayers! She Diagnosed With This Serious Disease... The video has a misleading title that may have confused many, but it doesn't report Cher's death. It instead comprises a number of photographs of Cher along with a digitally-generated voice reciting various biographical aspects of her life and speculations about her health. Cher has had a prolific and culturally significant career in music and won an Academy Award in 1988 for the movie Moonstruck. If she did die, it would no doubt be the subject of many news reports from legitimate sources, but there are no such stories as of this writing. It's not the first time she has been the subject of a celebrity death hoax, however. In 2012, similar rumors spread about her. Other celebrities who have been the target of similar false rumors include Dwayne The Rock Johnson and Eddie Murphy.	https://www.snopes.com/news/2022/09/22/online-death-hoaxes-popular/:-:https://snopes.com/fact-check/rating/false:-:https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/dwayne-johnson-death-hoax/:-:https://archive.is/nF6sj:-:https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/eddie-murphy-death-hoax/:-:https://www.snopes.com/tag/celebrity-death-hoaxes/:-:https://archive.is/wip/9LfiK	Cher Death Hoax	['entertainment', 'cher']							25603	false	, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,

The ad claimed: There Are a New Animal Species Taking Over at Chernobyl. Encyclopedia Brittanica published that the Chernobyl incident was the worst disaster in the history of nuclear power generation. History.com reported much the same: However, the clickbait picture in the ad did not depict a new animal species that was taking over at Chernobyl. The resulting 30-page slideshow article didn't even mention the photograph. In reality, it showed a spectacled (hairless) Andean bear named Dolores. On Nov. 5, 2009, BBC reported that Dolores and two other bears were dealing with various states of baldness. They came from the Andean mountains of Ecuador, Peru, and northern Bolivia. The picture in the advertisement was perhaps chosen for the reason mentioned by Baars. Even the director of the International Bear Foundation didn't know it was a bear. Readers who saw the ad likely wouldn't initially identify the animal as a bear, either. Jan Woitas and the European Pressphoto Agency were credited for the photograph that was used in the ad. It appeared to be from 2009. https://www.shutterstock.com/editorial/image-editorial/germany-animals-nov-2009-8209359b Also on Nov. 5, 2009, the Associated Press posted a video of Dolores, Bianca, and Lolita at the Leipzig Zoo. The zoo official, who was not identified, spoke of research that was underway about the issue with the bears. He also mentioned that other zoos had seen similar problems with such bears. At least two blogs mentioned that Dolores died in 2011. We were unable to confirm this information with any credible source. However, one thing we can say for sure is that she was not a new species that was taking over at Chernobyl. For further reading, Scientific American reported on the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone in December 2020. The story looked at the possibility of lingering radiation effects on animal populations.	https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/obama-apology-hiroshima/:-:https://snopes.com/fact-check/rating/miscaptioned:-:https://archive.vn/xzVp7:-:https://www.britannica.com/event/Chernobyl-disaster:-:https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2021/01/new-animal-species-ad-chernobyl-small.jpg:-:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yH3Y-zcGhwE:-:https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/chernobyl-exclusion-zone-radiation-doses-reanalyzed/:-:https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2021/01/GettyImages-93085507-e1611966046228.jpg:-:https://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/8345550.stm:-:https://www.shutterstock.com/editorial/image-editorial/germany-animals-nov-2009-8209359b:-:https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2021/01/GettyImages-92706493-e1611966164742.jpg:-:https://www.snopes.com/contact:-:https://www.history.com/topics/1980s/chernobyl	Is This a 'New Animal Species Taking Over Chernobyl'?

This image has been digitally altered. This image has been circulating since at least 2020. It appears to have started circulating in the wake of a December 2020 controversy in which Tesco was criticized for selling a product labeled British Carrots that had been grown in Spain. One of the earliest postings (and possibly the original version of this image) came from Twitter user Mike Neaverson, the CEO of the soil management company Neaverson Growers Ltd. Neaverson followed this tweet with a thread explaining that this image was fake and that the real photograph, which showed a British Carrots product labeled as grown in Spain had been a simple mistake. The thread read in part: Tesco would also issue an apology and explain that the grown in Spain label had been an accident. A Tesco spokesperson said: While the fake Chernobyl-grown carrots photo was created as a joke to mock the incorrectly labeled grown in Spain bags, it appears that this doctored image used a correctly labeled Grown in UK bag of carrots as its base. If you look closely at the Chernobyl picture, you can see a bit of digital white out covering the letters UK.

25608				false				snopes		https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/chester-bennington-and-chris-cornell-murdered/	Chester Bennington and Chris Cornell were murdered because they were about to reveal a ring of pedophiles.	2017-07-21	snopes	Bethania Palma	On 21 July 2017, the junk news website Your News Wire (now News Punch) published a story reporting that Linkin Park singer Chester Bennington, who passed away on 20 July 2017 in his Palos Verdes Estates home near Los Angeles, had been murdered in similar fashion to his friend, Soundgarden singer Chris Cornell, who died two months earlier. Both Bennington's and Cornell's deaths have been ruled suicides by hanging by Los Angeles County and Wayne County medical examiners, respectively. Cornell died on 18 May 2017 in his hotel room after a concert in Detroit, while Bennington passed away at his Palos Verdes Estates home on 20 July 2017. The two men were friends — in fact, Bennington took his life on what would have been Cornell's 53rd birthday. But rumors that their deaths were connected in any nefarious way are based on speculation and not evidence, and Your News Wire's headline thus falsely proclaims Police: Chester Bennington Was Murdered. Citing a police source, Your News Wire asserted that authorities were investigating Bennington's death as a homicide: It's unclear what detectives Your News Wire could possibly have obtained such a quote from. Palos Verdes Estates police have not commented on the case and have instead referred all inquiries to the coroner's office. The police department for that small coastal community south of Los Angeles contracts with the much larger Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department to handle homicides, and the Sheriff's Homicide Bureau told us they did not respond to Bennington's death. The quote doesn't appear in any other news report about the incident. We have spoken to all the agencies that have jurisdiction over Bennington's home and can confirm that, contrary to what Your News Wire reported, law enforcement has not said Bennington was murdered. The celebrity status of both men means relevant details about their deaths are publicly available. Cornell's autopsy report has been uploaded online, and in that report, Wayne County assistant medical examiner Dr. Theodore Brown notes that Cornell's bodyguard discovered him in the bathroom of his Detroit hotel room with an exercise band around his neck. Ligature marks were found around Cornell's neck, and the cause of death was determined to be suicide by hanging. The Los Angeles County Coroners told us the official cause of Bennington's death was also a suicide by hanging and that an autopsy report would be forthcoming at the end of July 2017. Your News Wire also quoted Randy Cody, a person they described as an investigator: Cody may be an amateur sleuth, but he is not a law enforcement investigator. He is a blogger who runs The Metal Den web site, where he occupies himself coming up with various theories to prove Cornell was murdered. He was interviewed for a Detroit News story about theories surrounding the singer's death by fans unsatisfied with the suicide ruling, which is where Your News Wire lifted this information from. A piece of supposed evidence cited by Cody is a head wound he believes he saw in a YouTube video of Cornell's last performance at Detroit's Fox Theater on 17 May 2017 and an unverified recording of radio traffic in which a medic claimed to have seen a wound on the head of an unnamed victim. No mention was made of a head wound in the autopsy report, prompting accusations that the information was suppressed. However in the image from the concert it appears the wound is simply red stage light reflecting off the singer's skin. In a 22 May 2017 post, Cody claimed Cornell was murdered because he was about to expose pedophiles involved in PizzaGate, a debunked conspiracy theory holding that a child sex trafficking ring linked to Hillary Clinton was being run out of Comet Ping Pong, a Washington, D.C., pizzeria. No evidence was offered linking Bennington to the non-existent PizzaGate conspiracy other than a circumstantial reference to a revelation he made in a rock magazine interview that he had been molested when he was a child. PizzaGate has been debunked by none other than conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, who was one of the key figures in originally spreading it. Jones apologized and retracted the claim after a man intent on rescuing children went to the pizzeria with a rifle in December 2016 and opened fire inside. Your News Wire is not a reliable source of information -- they regularly post inaccurate articles and unfounded conspiracy theories. There is no evidence that Bennington or Cornell were murdered in an effort to cover up a debunked pedophile sex ring.	https://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/local/detroit-city/2017/07/10/chris-cornell-death-fan-questions-unanswered/103567836/:-:https://themetalden.com/?p=56067:-:https://snopes.com/fact-check/rating/false:-:https://yournewswire.com/chester-bennington-murdered/:-:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wBJksAFkG0:-:https://www.snopes.com/tag/yournewswire-com/:-:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRbvgSBtheA:-:https://www.autopsyfiles.org/reports/Celebs/cornell,%20chris_report.pdf:-:https://www.cbsnews.com/news/chester-benningtons-death-echoes-that-of-friend-chris-cornell/:-:https://themetalden.com/?s=Chris+cornell:-:https://www.infowars.com/a-note-to-our-listening-viewing-and-reading-audiences-concerning-pizzagate-coverage/:-:https://www.snopes.com/pizzagate-conspiracy/	Were Chester Bennington and Chris Cornell Murdered to Cover Up a Pedophile Ring?

25609				true				snopes		https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/chestfeeding-breastfeeding/	A maternity department at a U.K. hospital announced in February 2021 that it was expanding terms it used in maternity care to include, for example, chestfeeding and pregnant people, in order to be more inclusive of trans and nonbinary patients.	2021-02-10	snopes	Madison Dapcevich	In early February 2021, some midwives in England and Wales were given guidance from their hospitals on ways to offer more support to transgender and nonbinary parents, including incorporating new gender-inclusive language using terms such as chestfeeding and birthing parents. The move made headlines and sparked controversy on social media between those who applauded the groundbreaking work and others who suggested that it was a waste of resources and risked confusion and undermining. It is true that on Feb. 10, 2021, maternity services at Brighton and Sussex University Hospitals (BSUH) announced it would expand language used to support midwives that provide care for trans and nonbinary people who give birth. The National Health Service (NHS) in England and Wales, which oversees the two hospitals, said that the vast majority of those who turn to midwifery are women and as such, are already comfortable with language that was already in place. To be clear, the NHS said that such language — like referencing pregnant women and breastfeed — will not change for those who identify as such. Furthermore, the work does not impact other maternity services and staff are not being asked to stop using language related specifically to women. Adding terms like chestfeeding and birthing parent was not intended to take away from women-oriented language already in use. Rather, the move was meant to be additional support that offers more inclusion for trans and nonbinary individuals. Another example of gender-inclusive language is the phrase pregnant women and people. Adding to the language we use is something people who use our services have been asking for, for some time, said BSUH Chief Nurse Carolyn Morrice in a statement. Our aim will always be to treat everyone who uses our services as an individual, providing care that is personal to them, that meets their needs and uses language they are comfortable with. It was not clear whether maternity care providers at these hospitals would be required to use the new terms in conversation with affected patients or whether the change would also be reflected in written materials or medical records. It’s not the first time such an initiative has been introduced. The breastfeeding advocacy and support group La Leche League released a joint statement in 2018 on behalf of its Canadian and American chapters that defined the term chestfeeding and the rationale for its use: The international nonprofit also offered a tip sheet offering ways to support transgender and nonbinary parents, found here.	https://twitter.com/LBC/status/1359486326232539136:-:https://archive.is/LNIAv:-:https://www.lllusa.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Joint-Statement-on-use-of-the-term-Chestfeeding.pdf:-:https://twitter.com/KentClairekent/status/1359502675843436549:-:https://www.bsuh.nhs.uk/supporting-inclusive-midwifery-care/:-:https://metro.co.uk/2021/02/10/brighton-midwives-told-to-say-chestfeeding-to-be-more-inclusive-14055419/:-:https://www.laleche.org.uk/support-transgender-non-binary-parents/:-:https://snopes.com/fact-check/rating/true:-:https://archive.is/7iaqb	Were UK Midwives Encouraged To Say 'Chestfeeding' To Be More Inclusive?

25610				true				snopes		https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/chet-hanks-tom-hanks-son/	Chet Hanks is actor Tom Hanks' son.	2021-04-01	snopes	Jordan Liles	In late March 2021, actor and musician Chet Hanks made headlines after making remarks in an Instagram video. This led Twitter users to tweet about Chet purportedly being the son of two-time Oscar winner Tom Hanks: One tweet included a video that was shared thousands of times: Another person shared an analogy: It's true that Chet Hanks is one of Tom Hanks' sons. His mother, Rita Wilson, is also an actor in major motion picture roles. Tom Hanks also had another son, Colin, and a daughter, Elizabeth, with his previous spouse, Samantha Lewes. Hanks and Lewes divorced in 1987. The reason why Chet Hanks was being tweeted about in late March and early April was because of two news stories. One involved a phrase from his Instagram videos, while the other was about a purportedly violent incident reported by TMZ. In an Instagram video from late March, Chet Hanks said he had feeling that it was about to be a white boy summer. VICE reported of the phrase: According to Chet, White Boy Summer ultimately means 'nothing but good vibes towards everybody, that means everybody.' He explicitly calls out prejudicial beliefs against anyone from a different background than you, while also encouraging his viewers to 'keep suck-a-duckin.' According to Los Angeles Magazine, the white boy summer concept also included a number of rules about clothing and phrases. On March 31, TMZ published a video that showed a purportedly bloodied Chet Hanks after an altercation with an ex-girlfriend: The video appeared just days after Hanks' white boy summer comments were trending online. Hanks also was no stranger to trolling viewers when it came to the debunked ideas in the QAnon conspiracy theory. In a March 2020 video, he made fun of a lot of Trump supporters who purportedly believed Tom Hanks and his family were all involved in elite pedophile sex trafficking rings: We previously debunked the false rumor. On March 31, @StephBencin tweeted the joke: If Tom Hanks is America's dad, that means Chet is America, which totally tracks. The same was also tweeted earlier by @TheMarkDowling. In sum, it's true that Chet Hanks is the son of Hollywood actor Tom Hanks.	https://twitter.com/_Zeets/status/1375895923327401989:-:https://www.tmz.com/2021/03/31/chet-hanks-ex-girlfriend-domestic-violence-restraining-order-countersue/:-:https://www.snopes.com/news/2020/08/21/qanon-2020-election/:-:https://www.biography.com/actor/tom-hanks:-:https://www.lamag.com/culturefiles/chet-hanks-white-boy-summer/:-:https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/tom-hanks-ankle-bracelet/:-:https://twitter.com/travis_view/status/1241165218031390720:-:https://twitter.com/StephBencin/status/1377296633914871808:-:https://www.instagram.com/p/CM5sjzbgyQr/:-:https://www.instagram.com/p/CM-h_pwgCXb/:-:https://twitter.com/jayxholloway/status/1376985371192483845:-:https://www.vice.com/en/article/y3gavw/unpacking-chet-hanks-complex-white-boy-summer-taxonomy:-:https://twitter.com/TheMarkDowling/status/1354447838193852417:-:https://snopes.com/fact-check/rating/true:-:https://twitter.com/1992_rp/status/1375652154044731394:-:https://www.imdb.com/name/nm2721320/	Is Chet Hanks Tom Hanks' Son?

25611				false				snopes		https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/chevrolet-nova-name-spanish/	The Chevrolet Nova sold poorly in Spanish-speaking countries because its name translates as doesn't go in Spanish.	1999-04-02	snopes	David Mikkelson	It's the classic cautionary tale about the pitfalls of doing business in foreign countries that can be found in hundreds (if not thousands) of books about marketing: General Motors introduced their Chevrolet Nova model of automobile into a Spanish-speaking market, then scratched their heads in puzzlement when it sold poorly. GM executives were baffled until someone finally pointed out to them that nova translates as doesn't go in Spanish. The embarrassed automobile giant changed the model name to the Caribe, and sales of the car took off. This anecdote is frequently used to illustrate the perils of failing to do adequate preparation and research before introducing a product into the international marketplace. It's a wicked irony, then, that the people who use this example are engaging in the very thing they're decrying, because a little preparation and research would have informed them that it isn't true. (The sources that repeat this little tale can't even agree on where the Nova supposedly sold poorly, variously listing locales such as Puerto Rico, Mexico, South America, or simply Spanish-speaking countries.) This is another one of those tales that makes its point so well -- just like the fable about George Washington and the cherry tree -- that nobody wants to ruin it with a bunch of facts. Nonetheless, we're here to ruin it. The original Chevrolet Nova (initially the Chevy II) hit the U.S. market in 1962. (This car should not be confused with the smaller, front wheel drive vehicle which was produced in 1985 as a joint venture between General Motors and Toyota and also assigned the Nova name.) Between 1972 and 1978 the Chevrolet Nova was also sold in Mexico and several other Spanish-speaking countries, primarily Venezuela. Shortly afterwards the great Nova legend arose, a legend which a little linguistic analysis shows it to be improbable: The truth is that the Chevrolet Nova's name didn't significantly affect its sales: it sold well in both its primary Spanish-language markets, Mexico and Venezuela, and its Venezuelan sales figures actually surpassed GM's expectations. The whole Nova = doesn't go tale was merely another in a long line of automotive jokes, like the ones about Ford being an acronym for Fix or repair daily or Found on road dead or Fiat being an acronym for Fix it again, Tony! These humorous inventions might adequately reflect the tellers' feelings about the worthiness of various types of automobiles, but we don't really expect that anyone ever refrained from buying a Ford because he actually believed they needed to be repaired on a daily basis. The one bit of supporting evidence offered to back up this legend is spurious as well. General Motors, we're told, finally wised up and changed the model name of their automobile from Nova to Caribe, after which sales of the car took off. The problem with this claim is that the Caribe sold in Mexico was manufactured by Volkswagen, not by General Motors. (The Caribe was the model name used by VW in Mexico for the car more commonly known in the USA as the Volkswagen Golf.) The Nova's model name was never changed for the Spanish-speaking market. The Chevy Nova legend lives on in countless marketing textbooks, is repeated in numerous business seminars, and is a staple of newspaper and magazine columnists who need a pithy example of human folly. Perhaps someday this apocryphal tale will become what it should be: an illustration of how easily even experts can sometimes fall victim to the very same dangers they warn us about.	https://snopes.com/fact-check/rating/false	Did the Chevrolet Nova Fail to Sell in Spanish-Speaking Countries?

25612				false				snopes		https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/chevron-and-the-national-guard/	Chevron has denied accommodation to Louisiana National Guard helicopters battling the Gulf oil spill.	2010-06-03	snopes	David Mikkelson	Example: [Collected via e-mail, June 2010] As most of you already know the Louisiana National Guard is helping fight the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. But did you know that the La. National Guard helicopters are being denied landing and purchase of fuel at the Chevron Venice base. Petroleum Helicopters, Inc. (PHI), Air Logistics, Bristow and one other helicopter base just north of Venice are allowing full use of their bases and fuel supplies to our La. Nat. Guard Units. If it were not for the permission of these bases to allow fueling and landing privileges, our Guard Copters would need to return to Hammond, La. for fuel and necessary provisions to continue the fight against this oil spill.When Chevron was queried about the denial to use their base, the answer was that it would cause a conflict of interest. Now just what the hell does that mean? I in fact know that some of Chevron's copter pilots were formally in the La. National Guard. And that when they were ordered to participate in the Iraq war they complained of poor health, bad backs, etc. They were discharged from the La. Guard, but of course bad health, bad backs, etc. they continued to fly for Chevron. Seems they were more interested in an easy pay check for weekend military duty with the La. Guard then service to their country.From now on I will gladly refuel my vehicles at any other gas station that does not display the Chevron symbol since I now have a conflict of interest with you. Origins: Although most of the blame and criticism regarding the Gulf of Mexico oil spill which began in late April 2010 (and was still unresolved by early June) has been aimed at British Petroleum (the company who licensed the drilling rig that triggered the spill), other businesses have also become critical targets. The anonymous message reproduced above, for example, criticizes Chevron for supposedly denying to accommodate Louisiana National Guard helicopters engaged in battling the oil spill, requiring those helicopters to seek landing and refueling facilities elsewhere. However, a memorandum from Louisiana National Guard Commanding Colonel Patrick Bossetta issued in response to this rumor notes that Louisiana National Guard helicopters were not being denied landing and purchase of fuel at Chevron's facilities; the company merely requested prior coordination to minimize the impact on Chevron's day-to-day operations: I am writing in reference to an anonymous e-mail sent out regarding Chevron, Inc.'s support of the Louisiana Army National Guard aircraft performing aviation missions in support of the Deep Water Horizon Oil Spill.As the acting State Aviation Officer for the Louisiana Army National Guard, we have been tasked daily with supporting clean up and prevention efforts in Southeast Louisiana since May 1, 2010. With prior coordination through several personnel at Chevron-Venice, our aircraft have been allowed to refuel at the Venice base on multiple occasions. The Chevron personnel based in Venice have in my estimation been accommodating. The request for prior coordination in order to not interfere with Chevron's day to day operations seems a quite understandable and reasonable request given the current circumstances. I can only remember on one occasion that we could not use the Chevron base due to Presidential aircraft support.The Louisiana National Guard appreciates Chevron's support during this operation as well as the support they have given us concerning their employees who are members of the Louisiana Army National Guard.Chevron Corporation's media team also told us that: Chevron is providing both direct and indirect support to BP and the government to help stop the leak and assist with the spill response. In addition to providing access to our helicopter base, Chevron has provided:Expert support to BP's efforts, including technical experts to BP in the areas of subsea wells, subsea blowout preventer (BOP) intervention, subsea construction, environmental science, and emergency response.Wildlife experts who work for Chevron Energy Technology Company. They are assisting with long term wildlife management plans and hurricane evacuation plans.Subsea equipment to BP.Personnel to join the Coast Guard's local incident command response team in Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and Florida.Access to a marine wildlife rescue portable trailer as an additional resource.	https://snopes.comchevron.pdf:-:https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE6503IJ20100601	Chevron and the National Guard	['politics', 'gasoline', 'asp article']						{'politics'}	25612	false	, business_pred, , , , , , , , , , , , politics_pred, , , , , , ,

25614				false				snopes		https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/chevy-duty/	A group of former General Motors workers furtively produced 1957 Chevrolet automobiles on their own for ten years.	2007-11-01	snopes	David Mikkelson	Many a product has gone through the life cycle of development, marketing, and then eventual obsolescence when its manufacturer determined it no longer sold well enough to justify continued production or decided to focus on offering a newer and better version. Upon occasion, however, a discontinued product has retained a strong enough following among a devoted group of aficionados for another company to venture licensing or purchasing the rights from the original manufacturer and resuming production. (One example of this phenomenon occurred when INTV bought the rights to the Intellivision video game system from Mattel, selling off old inventory and then producing new consoles and game cartridges.) That's the basic idea behind a tale from the original (1975) edition of The People's Almanac, about a group of disenchanted General Motors stylists who left the company and spent ten years between 1958 and 1967 cranking out a few hundred thousand copies of the discontinued 1957 model Chevrolet at a small, private plant in Illinois — but the kicker is that they supposedly did all this without the knowledge, cooperation, or consent of General Motors: The story seems a fairly obvious bit of humor chock full of tongue-in-cheek jabs at the auto industry (especially evident in the closing reference to Volkswagen's supposed interest in opening a U.S. plant to produce 1973 Buick Rivieras — this was written in 1975, shortly after the Riviera had also undergone a significant and much-criticized design change), but its inclusion in a reference work with no external indicator of its fictional status has led many readers in the years since to take it seriously. For those who prefer a more thorough debunking, we highlight a few of the tale's many implausibilities below: We don't know how this tale ended up being published in The People's Almanac: whether the compilers decided to include bit of drollery in the book as lark, or a prankish writer managed to slip a gag past unsuspecting editors, or a gullible researcher was taken in by a tall tale. But the story is indeed a joke, and, judging by the results, a good one at that. In honor of the 50th anniversary of the classic automobile's introduction, CARS Inc. announced in 2006 that they would begin offering newly-[re]built (from original cowls) 1957 Chevrolet convertibles.	https://www.57classicchevy.com/:-:https://www.musclecarclub.com/musclecars/buick-riviera/buick-riviera-history.shtml:-:https://snopes.com/fact-check/rating/false:-:https://www.1957chevybody.com/:-:https://www.intellivisionlives.com/	Were 1957 Chevies Secretly Produced Until 1967?

25615				false				snopes		https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/chevy-revolt/	The Chevy Volt costs more than 7 times as much to run and takes 3 times as long to drive across country than a standard automobile.	2012-02-20	snopes	David Mikkelson	Examples: [Collected via e-mail, February 2012] I know, but I want to save our planet ---Cost to operate a Chevy VoltEric Bolling (Fox Business Channel's Follow the Money) test drove the Chevy Volt at the invitation of General Motors.For four days in a row, the fully charged battery lasted only 25 miles before the Volt switched to the reserve gasoline engine. Eric calculated the car got 30 mpg including the 25 miles it ran on the battery. So, the range including the 9 gallon gas tank and the 16 kwh battery is approximately 270 miles. It will take you 4 1/2 hours to drive 270 miles at 60 mph. Then add 10 hours to charge the battery and you have a total trip time of 14.5 hours. In a typical road trip your average speed (including charging time) would be 20 mph.According to General Motors, the Volt battery holds 16 kwh of electricity. It takes a full 10 hours to charge a drained battery.The cost for the electricity to charge the Volt is never mentioned so I looked up what I pay for electricity.I pay approximately (it varies with amount used and the seasons) $1.16 per kwh.- 16 kwh x $1.16 per kwh = $18.56 to charge the battery.$18.56 per charge divided by 25 miles = $0.74 per mile to operate the Volt using the battery.Compare this to a similar size car equipped with only a 4 cylinder gasoline engine that gets 32 mpg.- $3.19 per gallon divided by 32 mpg = $0.10 per mile.The gasoline powered car cost about $15,000 while the Volt costs $46,000.So Obama wants us to pay 3 times as much for a car that costs more that 7 times as much to run and takes 3 times as long to drive across country.REALLY? No wonder GM is having trouble selling the Volt !  Origins: In February 2012, Eric Bolling did test drive a Chevy Volt and report on his experience for Fox News, noting (among other factors) that the Volt took 12 hours to charge and ran for only about 25 miles before discharging the battery and switching over to the gasoline engine, aspects he found particularly disappointing for an automobile that cost $46,500 and was heavily subsidized with taxpayer money: However, this criticism somewhat misses the mark, as the Chevy Volt is not intended to be a car drivable for long distances in electric vehicle (EV) mode: It's a niche vehicle that attempts to offset the current EV issues of limited range and scarcity of charging stations by combining EV capabilities with a gasoline engine to provide enough battery range to satisfy many consumers' daily driving needs while also accommodating extended travel beyond that range. As noted in Car and Driver's full test report on the 2011 Chevrolet Volt: The Volt sets itself apart from the Nissan Leaf and the forthcoming EV crowd: It also has a gas engine that can step in to extend the Volt's range when the battery's energy is depleted. This is why GM calls the Volt an extended-range electric vehicle, and the dual-power-source arrangement makes a lot of sense at a time when there's precious little charging infrastructure. Currently, 48 of 50 states have fewer than 10 charging stations, and even California's relative abundance of 422 pales in comparison to its roughly 10,400 gas stations. In other words, it's going to be some time before charging while at work or out on the town becomes the norm; for now, EVs' batteries will be replenished largely at home. And with maximum ranges in the 100-mile neighborhood, good luck with any long- or even moderate-distance travel. And forget about having a pure electric as your only vehicle.What if your family in California needs you to visit? While a pure EV — needing long recharging sessions every 70 miles or so — will transport you back to the era of the monthlong road trip, the Volt could easily drive across the country on gas when there's no time or electricity available for recharging. Closer to home, if this writer had been driving a Leaf instead of a Volt, I would have had to deal a blow of rejection to a five-year-old nephew whose birthday party was 60 miles distant, due to the lack of a place to charge while there. And although the Volt has both a gas engine and two electric motors — one primarily to power the wheels and a second to generate electricity from the gas engine — it is unlike any gas-electric hybrid on the road today: If charged sufficiently, it can operate continuously, at any speed, as an EV, without ever needing to switch on the gas engine.The e-mailed item reproduced above starts out by claiming that: It will take you 4 1/2 hours to drive 270 miles at 60 mph. Then add 10 hours to charge the battery and you have a total trip time of 14.5 hours. In a typical road trip your average speed (including charging time) would be 20 mph.This statement is nonsensical, as time spent charging the Volt's battery has nothing to do with elapsed driving time; recharging would be performed before the beginning and/or after the end of a trip. On an extended road trip, the Volt's driver certainly wouldn't be stopping every 270 miles to spend 10 hours recharging the battery, as implied here — instead, under such circumstances the driver would simply refill the Volt's gas tank as needed and skip recharging the battery until the conclusion of the journey. Next, the portions of this item dealing with energy-related operating costs of the Chevy Volt are unrealistic because they are based on erroneous assumptions and energy prices not reflective of current norms. When empirical data and standard energy prices are used, the operating costs for the Chevy Volt compare favorably with standard gasoline-powered automobiles. For starters, although the Chevy Volt stores 16 kwh of energy in its battery pack, it actually uses only 9.6 kwh for propulsion and about another 3-4 kwh during the charging process, so recharging the Volt's battery does not typically require a full 16 kwh of electricity. As Car and Driver found during their Volt road tests: In our experience, using only standard-household 120-volt power, it took about 13.4 kwh of electricity to replenish the Volt's 9 kWh of usable energy. Using a 240-volt setup instead is more efficient and would have boosted the mileage figure. As well, Car and Driver observed that the 25 mile electric-range figure for the Volt was not an average mileage figure, but rather the product of worst-case scenario driving: GM's recently revised electric-range claim is 25 to 50 miles, and we ended up in the low to middle of that band. Getting on the nearest highway and commuting with the 80-mph flow of traffic — basically the worst-case scenario — yielded 26 miles; a fairly spirited back-road loop netted 31; and a carefully modulated cruise below 60 mph pushed the figure into the upper 30s.Additionally, the figures given for the Chevy Volt above are calculated using a price of $1.16 per kwh (kilowatt hour) of electricity. Although electricity costs vary from place to place, nowhere in the United States is the average residential retail price of electricity anywhere close to $1.16 per kwh. The average consumer price for electricity in the United States in December 2011 was only $0.127 per kwh. Using that average price as a baseline and factoring in the proper amount of battery charging time (while maintaining a worst-case scenario mileage assumption), the quoted figures work out as follows: 13.4 kwh x $0.127 per kwh = $1.70 to charge the battery.$1.70 per charge divided by 25 miles = $0.07 per mile to operate the Volt using the battery.The national average price of a gallon of gasoline in the United States in February 2012 was $3.565, quite a bit more than the $3.19 per gallon figure cited above, so using current average costs, the comparison to a conventional gasoline-powered automobile would work out as follows: Compare this to a similar size car equipped with only a 4 cylinder gasoline engine that gets 32 mpg.$3.565 per gallon divided by 32 mpg = $0.11 per mile.So, according to the criteria used by the author of this item, rather than being a car that costs more than 7 times as much to run and takes 3 times as long to drive across country than a gasoline-powered 4-cylinder car, the Volt costs about one-third less to run (in electric mode) and takes the same amount of time to drive across country.

Its caption said: Greta Thunberg briefly crossed paths with Donald Trump at the United Nations in New York on Monday. Thunberg, the Swedish climate activist, fixed Trump with a steady stare as he arrived at the UN to attend a meeting on religious freedom. The US president decided to snub a major UN climate summit, held on the same day[.] In separate coverage, the same news organization reported on Trump and Thunberg’s appearances at the United Nations Climate Summit on September 23 2019. NBC News published a transcript of Thunberg’s speech, in which she castigated world leaders for their inaction: This is all wrong. I shouldn’t be up here. I should be back in school on the other side of the ocean. Yet, you all come to us young people for hope. How dare you! You have stolen my dreams and my childhood with your empty words and yet I’m one of the lucky ones. People are suffering. People are dying. Entire ecosystems are collapsing. We are in the beginning of a mass extinction and all you can talk about is money and fairytales of eternal economic growth. How dare you! For more than 30 years, the science has been crystal clear. How dare you continue to look away and come here saying that you’re doing enough when the politics and solutions needed are still nowhere in sight. Although the photograph or GIF of Greta Thunberg often appeared solely as an image or animated GIF, it was accurately described. In longer videos, Thunberg’s facial expression matched the stills, and Trump was captured entering the frame and speaking.

Claim In 2009's H1N1 (swine flu) pandemic, 1.4 billion people were sickened globally, and nearly 600,000 died. Rating Not True Like this fact check? Reporting Under tweets that didn’t age well, on April 2 2020 pundit Bill Mitchell criticized measures to stop the spread of COVID-19 — claiming that the 2009 H1N1 (swine flu) pandemic infected 1.4 billion people worldwide and killed almost 600,000: https://twitter.com/mitchellvii/status/1245791988387110918 Mitchell tacked on a claim that we wrecked the economy over COVID-19, implying that economic downturns were avoidable without social distancing — which is an opinion that is not necessarily grounded in any facts. The Tweet He said: BREAKING NEWS: COVID-19 just surpassed 1 million cases worldwide. Only 1,399,000,000 cases to go until it matches the 1.4 billion cases of H1N1 in 2009. 51,560 deaths and only 525,000 to go to match H1N1. I am sure am glad we wrecked the economy over this, aren’t you? According to Mitchell, a total 1.4 billion people were infected during the H1N1 pandemic, and 576,560 (525,000 + 51,560) people died globally during the swine flu pandemic. Actual Numbers Mitchell didn’t provide a citation for his sources in the April 2 2020 tweet above, but the 1.4 billion statistic (and a similar mortality figure) appeared in a March 18 2020 LiveScience article: It’s been a little over a decade since the world experienced its last pandemic, the 2009 H1N1 swine flu. Between the spring of 2009 and the spring of 2010, the virus infected as many as 1.4 billion people across the globe and killed between 151,700 and 575,400 people , according to the Centers for Disease Protection and Control. Now, the world is in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, caused by a novel coronavirus called SARS-CoV-2. Florida is where wokes go to die... Please enable JavaScript Florida is where wokes go to die The context of that reporting was relevant. Although Mitchell claimed that there were 1.4 billion cases of H1N1 in 2009 and just under 600,000 deaths, LiveScience included ranges for both: ... as many as 1.4 billion infected; ... between 151,700 and 575,400 deaths. Reference to as many as and between alluded to a range of estimates, and Mitchell sifted out the absolute highest numbers to attempt to make his point. But even that short excerpt contained additional context — namely, that those figures were compiled well after the H1N1 pandemic had ended. Comparing rates of infections and deaths at the beginning of a pandemic versus years after one ends is obviously going to yield misleading and unsteady comparisons, since as of April 2 2020, a large number of people had yet to fall ill with or die from COVID-19. LiveScience.com cited the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for its statistic, and linked to this page (2009 H1N1 Pandemic.) The number 1.4 billion does not appear anywhere on that page, and the statistic appears to have been extrapolated from either this portion: Though the 2009 flu pandemic primarily affected children and young and middle-aged adults, the impact of the (H1N1)pdm09 virus on the global population during the first year was less severe than that of previous pandemics. Estimates of pandemic influenza mortality ranged from 0.03 percent of the world’s population during the 1968 H3N2 pandemic to 1 percent to 3 percent of the world’s population during the 1918 H1N1 pandemic. It is estimated that 0.001 percent to 0.007 percent of the world’s population died of respiratory complications associated with (H1N1)pdm09 virus infection during the first 12 months the virus circulated. Or from 2013 estimates that one in five people globally had contracted H1N1 in 2009 and 2010: The study, which used data from 19 countries, collated results from more than 24 studies involving some 90,000 blood samples collected before, during and after the pandemic. The results, published in the journal Influenza and Other Respiratory Viruses, showed 20 to 27 percent of people studied were infected during the first year of the pandemic . Once again, those figures were the high end of a range, and estimated. Interim COVID-19 Infections and Deaths Incidentally, 22 days after Mitchell’s tweet, on April 24 2020, nearly 200,000 people worldwide had died of COVID-19 (and more than 50 thousand of those deaths were in the United States): Does the United States Have 4 Percent of the World’s Population and 25 Percent of the Deaths from COVID-19? Cherry picking in the same fashion Mitchell did could, for instance, support the argument that as of April 24 2020, more people died of COVID-19 early in the pandemic than had died in the lower range of estimates for the totality of the H1N1/swine flu pandemic (151,700). Pandemics and Wide Estimated Ranges On April 23 2020, we examined a different pandemic comparison on Twitter, and noted that even the modern attempts to piece together exact figures were inexact: Did the Second Wave of the 1918 Spanish Flu Kill 20 to 30 Million, While the First Wave Killed 3 to 5 Million? Figures on the high ended tended to included guesses or estimates about those mildly sickened or otherwise not counted officially, and researchers created such tallies in a variety of ways in order to better quantify the long-term effects of pandemics. Although research and medical study have advanced by leaps and bounds since the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic, limitations in counting unreported cases continued to clearly hinder researchers’ ability to hammer down extremely precise numbers — leaving ranges as wide as between 151,700 and 575,400 deaths during a 2009-2010 pandemic. In Summation Mitchell claimed that 1.4 billion people were infected during the 2009-2010 H1N1 (swine flu) pandemic, and over 575,000 people died. Mitchell seemed to deliberately select the absolute highest end of very wide ranges, figures assessed years after that pandemic had come and gone. Mitchell’s tweet also appeared at the beginning of the novel coronavirus or COVID-19 pandemic, and within a few weeks, there had been more deaths globally (194,000) than the lowest range for the totality of the H1N1 pandemic (157,000). In short, not only was the premise flawed and dishonestly presented, but the claims were Not True .

Claim Hillary Clinton admitted she had an urge to run again in January 2020. Rating Decontextualized Like this fact check? Reporting On January 28 2020, the New York Post published an article with the headline , Hillary Clinton admits she feels an ‘urge’ to run against Trump again, reporting: Nearly four years after President Trump defeated her in the 2016 election, Hillary Clinton said she has an urge to run again because she thinks she can win this time [in 2020]. The former secretary of state was asked during an interview with Variety if she ever thought I could beat Donald Trump if I were running. Yeah. I certainly feel the urge because I feel the 2016 election was a really odd time and an odd outcome, she told the magazine in an interview published online [on January 28 2020]. Noting that Clinton received three million more votes than Trump (but lost in electoral college votes), the article continued: In a separate interview, Clinton said a lot has changed since 2016 when Trump won the presidency despite being a political novice. Florida is where wokes go to die... Please enable JavaScript Florida is where wokes go to die I think there’s a story now to be told. Before he was a blank slate. He was a guy that people saw on their TVs. As you know, he was a reality TV star, Clinton said, according to the Associated Press. Now I think there’s a record that he’s going to have to be held accountable for. Clinton’s specter loomed large over Democratic Party politics in 2020, and in 2018, humor publication The Onion satirized her legacy (Hillary Launches Campaign To Raise $100 Million Or Else She’ll Run For President): CHAPPAQUA, NY — In a press conference announcing her plans for the 2020 election, Hillary Clinton told reporters she is launching a campaign Tuesday that will raise $100 million by the end of the year or else she will run for president. I’m very excited to roll out my initiative to secure this full amount within seven weeks, and if it is not successful — let me be very clear on this — I will once more fill out the paperwork to run for president and submit it to the Federal Election Commission, said Clinton, who stressed that she was absolutely serious about her new A Hundred Million Or Me campaign ... Although the New York Post item certainly implied Clinton running in 2020 as a possibility, its source material — a Variety interview — was more clear in context. The quotes came from the second of two questions below: [Interviewer] Do you know who you’re going to vote for in the 2020 Democratic primary? You don’t have to name who it is. [Clinton] I’m going to vote. I’m going to leave it at that. I’ll definitely vote. I vote every time there’s an election. And I am telling everybody here at Sundance, everywhere I go, please, please go out and vote. And then, whoever the nominee is, support the nominee, whether it’s someone you voted on or not in the primary process, because the most important responsibility we all have is to retire Donald Trump. [Interviewer] I know you’re not running for president, but do you ever feel the urge to think: I could beat Donald Trump if I were running. [Clinton] Yeah. I certainly feel the urge because I feel the 2016 election was a really odd time and an odd outcome. And the more we learn, the more that seems to be the case. But I’m going to support the people who are running now and do everything I can to help elect the Democratic nominee. In the Variety interview, Clinton’s response was not as cut and dried as it was presented in the New York Post article, although the wording was confusing. An interviewer asked if she had the urge to think she could beat Donald Trump in 2020, and Clinton responded that she certainly [felt] the urge because of the conditions of 2016. However, the urge in question was referenced in odd phrasing, since it seemed more regret over poor timing — Clinton seemed to be saying that she thought she could have beaten Trump if she ran against him as an incumbent, after his first years in office. Nevertheless, the urge referenced in context appeared less run again in 2020 and more go back in time and run in 2020 instead of 2016.

The vote linked by Crenshaw was a Motion to Recommit : The motion to recommit provides one final opportunity for the House to debate and amend a measure, typically after the engrossment and third reading of the bill, before the Speaker orders the vote on final passage. The motion is the prerogative of the Minority party and in many cases constitutes the Minority’s one opportunity to obtain a vote on an alternative or a proposal to improve the measure. In the case of a bill or a joint resolution, the Rules of the House prohibit the Rules Committee from reporting a special rule that denies a motion to recommit with instructions. Florida is where wokes go to die... Please enable JavaScript Florida is where wokes go to die The Democrats largely voted against the Motion to Recommit (not the bill itself): VITIATION OF EARLIER PROCEEDINGS – [Rep. Steny] Hoyer [D-MD] asked unanimous consent to vacate proceedings by which House Joint Resolution 28 was passed, and the motion to reconsider laid upon the table, to the end that the Chair put the question on passage of House Joint Resolution 28 de novo , and further that if a recorded vote or the yeas and nays are ordered on the question of passage of House Joint Resolution 28, further proceedings may be postponed through the legislative day of January 23, 2019, as though under clause 8 of rule 20. Agreed to without objection. The next action was on January 23 2019: On passage Passed by the Yeas and Nays: 229 – 184 That roll call vote ( here ), on passage, recorded 223 yeas and one nay from Democrats, and six yeas and 183 nays from Republicans. Both roll call votes were starkly divided along party lines, the former vote on the Motion to Recommit favored by Republicans and the latter vote on passage by Democrats. Complicating matters was a document in the comments [ PDF ], issued by the Executive Office of the President Office of Management and Budget: STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY H.J. Res. 27 — Further Additional Continuing Appropriations Act, 2019 and H.J. Res. 28 — Further Additional Continuing Appropriations Act, 2019 The Administration opposes H.J. Res. 27, the Further Additional Continuing Appropriations Act, 2019, making further continuing appropriations through February 1, 2019, and H.J. Res. 28, the Further Additional Continuing Appropriations Act, 2019, making further continuing appropriations through February 28, 2019. [...] If H.J. Res. 27, H.J. Res. 28, or any similar continuing resolution were presented to the President, his advisors would recommend that he veto the bill. If you found the proceedings’ nuance confusing, you’re not alone. On January 17 2019, RollCall.com reported : It seemed simple: The House on [January 17 2019] passed a continuing resolution that would reopen nine Cabinet departments through Feb. 28 [2019] on a voice vote, a result that devolved into partisan sparring on the floor as Republicans sought to vacate the vote and Democrats said, in effect, too bad. By the end, both sides hugged it out, vacated the initial vote, voted by voice again, and postponed a roll call vote until [January 23 2019]. It all started with passage, via voice vote on the resolution. Then the gavel came down, ending the vote. In a series of responses and subsequent parliamentary inquiries, the chair, Rep. G. K. Butterfield, D-N.C., ultimately ruled that the vote had been decided by voice vote, and that the motion to reconsider had been laid on the table. As a result, Minority Whip Steve Scalise, R-La., has asked unanimous consent that the House reconsider the vote on which the joint resolution passed. Majority Leader Steny H. Hoyer, D-Md., said, I’m not sure what’s going on, but I object. Confusion about where actions on the resolution lay appeared to reign in the chamber: In objecting to Scalise’s request, Hoyer said many members have already departed the Capitol to catch their planes home. Scalise responded by noting they can tell the members to return or to delay a recorded vote until next week. The majority does have it within their purview to work with us to agree by unanimous consent to make it a previous vote, Scalise said. Hoyer declined, saying he does not have the ability to do that by unanimous consent. I regret Mr. Speaker that I am not in a position to try cure the failure in my view, because I didn’t hear it ... the [chair] obviously did not hear it either, he said, referring to Republicans saying they requested a recorded vote. Had the chair heard it he would have honored it, Hoyer said. After the Democrats ruled against Republicans’ request, the members on their side of the aisle — dozens had stayed behind while most Democrats had cleared out of the chamber — started booing. Several Republicans shouted at the chair or across the aisle with comments like: You heard him and you walked away. We want to be heard. Is this how it’s going to be? Texas GOP Rep. Louie Gohmert added: Where was the vote on the motion to adjourn? There was none. RollCall.com reiterated that an apparent miscommunication over whether Republicans forgot to ask for a vote on the continuing resolution led to further partisan bickering: Hoyer said there was absolutely not any mistakes made by Butterfield while he was presiding over the floor during the CR vote. What happened was the Republicans forgot to ask for a vote — probably because they’re so used to not having to ask for a vote. ... Having said that, their mistake led to their members not being able to express their opinion on the vote and we’re going to allow them to do that. Hoyer said he did not personally look at the tape but his staff did and Butterfield waited 30 seconds for a Republican to ask for a recorded vote. And they just didn’t do it, he said. The White House has issued a veto threat against the temporary funding bill and Senate Republican leaders aren’t expected to take it up. President Donald Trump and Democratic leaders remain in a stalemate over border security funds with no signs of progress yet. Rep. Crenshaw’s tweet intimated that House Republicans voted to issue a single paycheck to furloughed workers, while House Democrats voted against the measure. Based on accounts of events in the chamber on the day of the vote, even present Congressmen and women were unclear on the events that occurred. The vote linked by Crenshaw was a Motion to Recommit, which was voted down largely by Democrats and up largely by Republicans. A subsequent vote on passage occurred on January 23 2019, and it was favored by Democrats, while Republicans mostly voted against it.

Claim Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detained a teenaged American citizen at a camp for nearly a month, despite receiving proof of his citizenship. Rating True Like this fact check? Reporting In July 2019, multiple news organizations reported that American-born teenager Francisco Galicia was apprehended and detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) the previous month — who then kept him for close to a month: A United States citizen has been detained by U.S. Customs and Border Protection and Immigration and Customs Enforcement for nearly a month, his lawyer confirmed to CBS News. Francisco Erwin Galicia was born in Dallas in 2000, a birth certificate provided by his lawyer, Claudia Galan, shows. Galan told CBS News she has provided ICE with several documents proving her client is a U.S. citizen. These documents include his birth certificate, his temporary I.D., health insurance cards and a high school school I.D. Galicia’s mother was not informed of his detention or whereabouts for several days. A July 22 2019 Dallas News article (A Dallas-born citizen picked up by the Border Patrol has been detained for three weeks) reported that the American teenager was taken into ICE custody on June 27 2019, along with his younger brother Marlon. Marlon Galicia was deported after two days: An 18-year-old Dallas-born U.S. citizen has been in the custody of U.S. Customs and Border Protection and Immigration and Customs Enforcement for more than three weeks, his attorney says. Florida is where wokes go to die... Please enable JavaScript Florida is where wokes go to die Now his family fears he may be deported. Francisco Erwin Galicia was detained at a CBP checkpoint in Falfurrias on June 27, said Claudia Galan, his attorney. Galicia was traveling with his 17-year-old brother Marlon Galicia and a group of friends from Edinburg where they live to Ranger College in North Texas for a soccer scouting event when they came upon a CBP checkpoint, said Sanjuana Galicia, his mother. It was about 8 p.m. Marlon, who was born in Mexico and lacked legal status, had only been through a border checkpoint on school trips and had never been pressed to provide travel documents. [...] [Attorney Claudia] Galan said she met with CBP officers [in July 2019] and presented them with Galicia’s birth certificate and some other documents but was unsuccessful in getting him released. She plans on presenting the same documents to ICE officers [the week of July 21 2019]. Galan told reporters that she provided proof to US Customs and Border Patrol (CBP) officials, as well as agents from ICE. Neither released the boy despite receiving the proofs: Galan said she met with CBP officers [weeks after Galicia’s detention] and presented them with Galicia’s birth certificate and some other documents but was unsuccessful in getting him released. She plans on presenting the same documents to ICE officers later [in July 2019]. Media reports about Galicia’s wrongful detention did not begin appearing until he had been detained for the better part of a month. Within days, subsequent reports indicated Galicia was released. A local July 23 2019 story , Edinburg teen released after wrongful detainment, confirmed that Galicia had been released: After nearly a month in detention, Edinburg student-athlete Francisco Erwin Galicia was released [on the] afternoon [of July 22 2019]. Following an interview with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, McAllen-based immigration attorney Claudia Galan confirmed to the media that her client, Galicia, had been released from custody after being held since Saturday at the South Texas Detention Complex in Pearsall, Texas. His detention came despite presenting a birth certificate showing that he was born in the U.S. Galan said that agents continued to detain the boy despite their clear and acknowledged access to information validating his birthright citizenship: ... Galan further noted that Border Patrol agents had his birth certificate from day one, and that his brother had said he overheard Border Patrol agents checking the database and saying that he did appear in the database as being born in Dallas, Texas, and that he was a U.S. citizen. Galan added: So Border Patrol did confirm this information yet they kept him under custody. CBS News reported that in cases like Galicia’s, holds are not supposed to last longer than 72 hours. Galicia was held for close to a month: Galicia was detained by the Border Patrol for well above the 72 hours that CBP says it is supposed to hold detainees. But in South Texas’ Rio Grande Valley, where Galicia was arrested, the Border Patrol is holding hundreds of adult men and women accused of entering the country illegally for longer than 72 hours. In McAllen, Texas, adult men are being held in fenced-in pens. Vice President Mike Pence visited those pens this month, and reports and video of conditions there sparked outrage. Galicia was released from detention on July 23 2019, just days after Galan alerted the media and told them that her client’s citizenship had repeatedly been proved to ICE and CBP to no avail: Francisco Erwin Galicia, a Dallas-born U.S. citizen, spent 23 days in the custody of U.S. Customs and Border Protection in conditions that made him so desperate he almost opted to self-deport. Galicia says he lost 26 pounds during that time in a South Texas immigrant detention center because officers didn’t provide him with enough food. He said he wasn’t allowed to shower and his skin was dry and dirty. He and 60 other men were crammed into an overcrowded holding area where they slept on the floor and were given only aluminum-foil blankets, he said. Some men had to sleep on the restroom area floor. Ticks bit some of the men and some were very sick, Galicia said. But many were afraid to ask to go to the doctor because CBP officers told them their stay would start over if they did, he said. The news organization also noted that Galicia was only released after their reporting shed light on the situation: Galicia was released [on the] afternoon [of July 22 2019] from the ICE detention center in Pearsall where he’d been since [the prior] Saturday. His release came less than 24 hours after The News first reported on his detention. Before [he was transferred to Pearsall], he’d been held for about three weeks at a CBP facility in Falfurrias, where he reported the squalid conditions. Galicia said that he tried to let his mother know that he and his brother had been detained en route to a soccer game, and that when he did so that agents informed him he did not have any rights. Agents have also not refused to return his documentation, leaving him unprotected in the event of another encounter with ICE or CBP agents: Francisco Galicia told Border Patrol agents that he was a citizen and presented them with a Texas ID, Social Security card and a wallet-sized birth certificate. But agents doubted the validity of his documents right away, Galicia said. Agents then took the brothers and another passenger into custody. They held them at the checkpoint for a day and then moved them to a CBP holding facility, where Francisco hoped he would be allowed a phone call. I told them we had rights and asked to make a phone call. But they told us, ‘You don’t have rights to anything’, Francisco Galicia said. [...] Powerless. That’s how I felt. How with all this proof that I was giving them could they hold me? he said. Galicia says the documents he presented at the CBP checkpoint have not been returned to him. Obed Manuel, a border reporter based in Texas, said Francisco Galicia is neither the first nor the only American citizen to be detained and face deportation. Manuel added that if ICE or CBP so much as think you are in the country without proper documentation, that they basically have right to hold you.

Claim Snow fell over parts of Canada in early June 2019. Rating True Like this fact check? Reporting On June 2 2019, a Facebook user shared the following image ( archived here ), purportedly showing a thick covering of snow that had fallen on that date in Québec. A reverse image search did not indicate that the user’s image of snow in Québec in June 2019 had been shared elsewhere beforehand, although that did not necessarily mean the photograph was unique and new. Various iterations of the same image quickly appeared on Twitter: Omg #neige #valdor pic.twitter.com/hHBg7Uknqo — Diane Gervais (@dianejess93) June 3, 2019 Snowfall was also reported in parts of Ontario . Older materials show that this is not completely unprecedented. Parts of the northeastern United States and Canada repeatedly experienced snowfalls in the second decade of the 1800s, which was thought to have been brought about by temporary ( but devastating ) climate change caused by volcanic eruptions worldwide: So things are already very cold in the early 18-teens, says Gillen D’Arcy Wood, a professor at the University of Illinois and author of Tambora: The Eruption That Changed the World. Then, on April 10, 1815, came The Big One. Mount Tambora, in Indonesia, erupted with unfathomable force, killing nearly 100,000 people directly and letting loose a reverberating boom that could be heard more than 1,000 km away. A dark haze hung in the sky. For years afterward, spectacularly weird red and purple, murky-looking sunsets were observed all around the world. Florida is where wokes go to die... Please enable JavaScript Florida is where wokes go to die The volcanic aerosols formed a blanket around the whole planet, filtering the sunlight. Everything was cast into a deep freeze, Wood says. It was the largest eruption in probably five or 10 thousand years. It built on the momentum of the 1809 eruption, and the last years of the 18-teens are the coldest of the entire millennium. Year after year of record cold followed. People took to referring to the date as 18-Hundred-and-Froze-to-Death and dubbed the misery-filled year of 1816, The Year Without a Summer. Even without the effects of volcanic ash in the air, regular snow in some parts of Canada is not unheard of in June and even July, as a July 2017 CBC Montreal video on Facebook demonstrated: https://www.facebook.com/CBCMontreal/videos/10154900258181298/?v=10154900258181298 According to French-language Canadian broadcaster MétéoMédia , snow did fall in Val d’Or on June 3 2019.

Claim Ivanka Trump said Dr. Fauci was trying to make her father look incompetent. Rating Not True Like this fact check? Reporting In mid-July 2020 a link circulated on social media, appearing to be an article reporting that Ivanka Trump had accused Dr. Anthony Fauci of trying to make her father, United States President Donald Trump, look incompetent: Ivanka Says Fauci Trying To Make My Father Look Incompetent https://t.co/0vVyyA8xM2 — Reesus PatriotTM (@ReesusP) July 15, 2020 Clicking through to the link led to a bizarre article dated July 13 2020. It began: Ivanka Trump has always been a daddy’s girl. Whether it’s showing her father the latest styles in flimsy lingerie, string bikinis, or rubbing his back and cooing like a sexy kitten, this blonde bombshell has been supportive of her ‘Pops.’ Now she’s unloading both barrels on Dr. Anthony Fauci, the head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. Florida is where wokes go to die... Please enable JavaScript Florida is where wokes go to die Fauci is a fraud, the first daughter told The Lint Screen. Instead of trying to help the president help Americans, Fauci is sabotaging everything and trying to make my father look incompetent. The ravishing vixen details the many betrayals Fauci has perpetrated. When Daddy first got into office, Fauci told him to get rid of the pandemic preparedness group, she said. Pops wanted to keep the group–– and even wanted to give it more resources, but Fauci said it was a waste of money. ‘Pandemics are very rare, Mr. President,’ he told him. So, my father did what Fauci said and eliminated all the people and plans put in place for pandemics. The foxy lady puts on a fresh coat of lip gloss, puckers, and continues. Then the coronavirus came and Fauci told Dad there was no need for masks. He said there’s only a couple of cases in the U.S. and it’s not going to be a big deal, Ivanka shakes her head. Fauci also told Daddy, ‘Don’t wear a mask, they’re very uncomfortable and look stupid.’ The article likely went viral based on its headline and not the content of the linked post. Its second-to-last paragraph read: Ivanka Trump walks from behind the wardrobe screen dressed in a mini-cut Catholic schoolgirl uniform with a push-up bra and tight white blouse. She struts in her four-inch stilettos and announces, Sorry, but this interview’s over. I have to go model this outfit for Daddy. Fashion shows are a traditional father-daughter activity for us. He loves it when I sit in his lap at the end of my show. Its description of Ivanka Trump as a ravishing vixen or foxy lady fond of string bikinis and flimsy lingerie didn’t read as standard news reporting. Nevertheless, people commenting on the tweet reacted as if the linked material was unquestionably true : Looking incompetent would be a far less dangerous proposition and an impossible to achieve upgrade for her father.

Claim Ivanka Trump quoted Thomas Jefferson to her father, United States President Donald Trump, but she chose a quote where Jefferson specifically denied something of which he was actually guilty. Rating Unknown Like this fact check? Reporting In early November 2019, a tweet by Ivanka Trump quoting Thomas Jefferson in defense of her father, United States President Donald Trump alongside a response in screenshot form on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/TheGoodLordAbove/photos/a.608095492611491/3383150395105973/?type=3&theater On October 31 2019, Ivanka Trump tweeted a partial quote: ...surrounded by enemies and spies catching and perverting every word that falls from my lips or flows from my pen, and inventing where facts fail them. -Thomas Jefferson’s reflections on Washington, D.C. in a letter to his daughter Martha. Some things never change, dad! — Ivanka Trump (@IvankaTrump) October 31, 2019 Trump added, referencing her father, that some things never change. In the response tweet by @zeddary, that user replied: You’re quoting Jefferson’s denial that he’d raped and impregnated a girl he kept as property. Which he did, in fact, do. Florida is where wokes go to die... Please enable JavaScript Florida is where wokes go to die Neither Trump nor the respondent referenced any source material, and many others replied with Jefferson quotes they felt were contrary to Trump’s demeanor as resident. Another popular tweet made the same claim , that Jefferson was denying fathering children with Sally Hemings : It's interesting Ivanka picked this example because the thing Jefferson's enemies were accusing him of — fathering a child with a slave — was absolutely something he did. 6 times as a matter of fact. Jefferson was bemoaning being called out for something he actually did. https://t.co/ZnvjPLrkjY — Rachel Joy Larris (@RachelLarris) October 31, 2019 References to the quote commonly claimed that it was from an 1800 letter from Jefferson to his daughter, and one of its scant appearances prior to Ivanka Trump’s tweet was in a December 2017 Newsweek opinion piece making the same claim and using the same truncated quote: In 1800, Thomas Jefferson bemoaned being surrounded by enemies and spies catching and perverting every word which falls from my lips or flows from my pen, and inventing where facts fail them. A search restricted to entries before September 2019 returned almost entirely misdated discourse about Ivanka Trump’s tweet, and almost nothing about the original quote in its context. However, one out-of-context version of the quote appeared on a National Archives page published in or before 2015. The National Archive also contained a document , From Thomas Jefferson to Martha Jefferson Randolph, 5 February 1801. The quotation Trump tweeted originated in that letter from Jefferson to his daughter, beginning with Jefferson consoling his daughter on her ill health, after which he spoke at length regarding two of her children, his grandchildren. That letter rendered in a run-on fashion, with no paragraph breaks and little capitalization. In a broader context, the excerpt in the tweet is bolded below, with breaks added: but I set much less store by talents than good dispositions: and shall be perfectly happy to see [grandson] Jefferson a good man, industrious farmer, & kind & beloved among all his neighbors: by cultivating these dispositions in him, and they may be immensely strengthened by culture, we may ensure his & our happiness: and genius itself can propose no other object.—nobody can ever have felt so severely as myself the prostration of family society from the circumstance you mention. worn down here with pursuits in which I take no delight, surrounded by enemies & spies catching & perverting every word which falls from my lips or flows from my pen, and inventing where facts fail them , I pant for that society where all is peace and harmony, where we love & are beloved by every object we see. and to have that intercourse of soft affections hushed & suppressed by the eternal presence of strangers goes very hard indeed; & the harder as we see that the candle of life is burning out, so that the pleasures we lose are lost forever. but there is no remedy. the present manners & usages of our country are laws we cannot repeal. they are altering by degrees; & you will live to see the hospitality of the country reduced to the visiting hours of the day, & the family left to tranquility in the evening. it is wise therefore under the necessity of our present situation to view the pleasing side of the medal: and to consider that these visits are evidences of the general esteem which we have been all our lives trying to merit. the character of those we recieve is very different from the loungers who infest the houses of the wealthy in general: nor can it be relieved in our case but by a revolting conduct which would undo the whole labor of our lives. it is a valuable circumstance that it is only thro’ a particular portion of the year that these inconveniences arise.—the election by the [House of Representatives] being on Wednesday next [in February 1801], & the next our post day, I shall be able to tell you something certain of it by my next letter. I believe it will be as the people have wished; but this depends on the will of a few moderate men; and they may be controuled by their party. I long to see the time approach when I can be returning to you, tho’ it may be for a short time only. these are the only times that existence is of any value to me. continue then to love me my ever dear Martha, and to be assured that to yourself, your sister & those dear to you, every thing in my life is devoted. ambition has no hold on me but thro’ you. my personal affections would fix me for ever with you. present me affectionately to mr Randolph. kiss the dear little objects of our mutual love, and be assured of the constancy & tenderness of mine to you. Adieu. In several popular response tweets, Jefferson was described as denying an action he actually did, namely fathering (as a widower) the children of one of his slaves, Sally Hemings. The claim is part of known, mainstream history, and Jefferson’s relationship with Hemings was a prominent aspect of his historical legacy . On Monticello.org, an entry devoted to Jefferson and Hemings began by stating: Years after his wife’s death, Thomas Jefferson fathered at least six of Sally Hemings’s children. Four survived to adulthood and are mentioned in Jefferson’s plantation records: Beverly, Harriet, Madison, and Eston Hemings. Sally Hemings worked for two and a half years (1787-89) in Paris as a domestic servant and maid in Jefferson’s household. While in Paris, where she was free, she negotiated with Jefferson to return to enslavement at Monticello in exchange for extraordinary privileges for herself and freedom for her unborn children. Decades later, Jefferson freed all of Sally Hemings’s children – Beverly and Harriet left Monticello in the early 1820s; Madison and Eston were freed in his will and left Monticello in 1826. Jefferson did not grant freedom to any other enslaved family unit. Jefferson was inaugurated in March 1801, with Aaron Burr as his vice president: Thomas Jefferson is inaugurated as the third president of the United States, becoming the first president inaugurated in Washington, D.C. Aaron Burr, who had tied Jefferson in electoral votes before losing the election in the House of Representatives, is inaugurated Vice President. Monticello.org provided a short history of the allegations during his presidency, noting that rumors preceded a news account published nearly two years after Jefferson’s letter to his daughter in late January or early February 1801: In September 1802, political journalist James T. Callender, a disaffected former ally of Jefferson, wrote in a Richmond newspaper that Jefferson had for many years kept, as his concubine, one of his own slaves. Her name is Sally, Callender continued, adding that Jefferson had several children by her. Although there had been rumors of a sexual relationship between Jefferson and an enslaved woman before 1802, Callender’s article spread the story widely. It was taken up by Jefferson’s Federalist opponents and was published in many newspapers during the remainder of Jefferson’s presidency. In that context, it seemed unlikely that Jefferson was outwardly addressing the allegations in correspondence with his daughter. A subsequent portion does mention a hinted denial from Jefferson in a letter. But that letter was dated 1805, not 1801: Jefferson’s policy was to offer no public response to personal attacks, and he apparently made no explicit public or private comment on this question (although a private letter of 1805 has been interpreted by some individuals as a denial of the story ). Sally Hemings left no known accounts. Until the advent of DNA testing and its application to the claims in the late 1990s and early 2000s, that aspect of Jefferson’s history was divisive among historians: The Jefferson-Hemings story was sustained through the 19th century by Northern abolitionists, British critics of American democracy, and others. Its vitality among the American population at large was recorded by European travelers of the time. Through the 20th century, some historians accepted the possibility of a Jefferson-Hemings connection and a few gave it credence, but most Jefferson scholars found the case for such a relationship unpersuasive. It wasn’t until 2000 that a formal conclusion was reached based on DNA evidence: Shortly after the DNA test results were released in November 1998, the Thomas Jefferson Foundation formed a research committee consisting of nine members of the foundation staff, including four with Ph.D.s. In January 2000, the committee reported that the weight of all known evidence—from the DNA study, original documents, written and oral historical accounts, and statistical data—indicated a high probability that Thomas Jefferson was the father of Eston Hemings, and that he was likely the father of all six of Sally Hemings’s children listed in Monticello records—Harriet (born 1795; died in infancy); Beverly (born 1798); an unnamed daughter (born 1799; died in infancy); Harriet (born 1801); Madison (born 1805); and Eston (born 1808). On October 31 2019, a CNN item said of the context of Jefferson’s 1801 letter to Martha Jefferson Randolph: Jefferson, in the letter, appears to be citing the tension between himself and his political enemies. He was likely referring to his rivalry with the Federalists and its allied press, which the University of Virginia’s Miller Center describes as having reached a level of personal animosity seldom equaled in American politics in 1800. We contacted historians at Monticello.org about the controversy, but have not received a response yet. It is true that Ivanka Trump tweeted a partial quote attributed to Thomas Jefferson, and further true that the quotation is authentic. In some contexts, it is inaccurately dated to the year 1800; the commentary was from a late January or early February 1801 letter from Jefferson to Randolph written prior to his inauguration. As of around 2000 it is officially accepted that Jefferson fathered Hemings’ children in the years following the death of his wife. Another aspect of the claim is that Trump inadvertently quoted a commentary in which Jefferson was denying that he fathered children with Hemings, which is where the claim gets historically shaky. Jefferson did father Hemings’ children, an allegation which existed only as a rumor until it was published in 1802. Monticello.org notes that Jefferson appeared to abstractly deny those claims in a letter, but that particular letter was written in 1805, not 1801. Based on the information available, it did not appear (contrary to assertions in response tweets) that Ivanka Trump quoted Jefferson’s denial of his relationship with Hemings, but because we cannot say for certain, we rate this claim Unknown .

Rowling confirmed that she is a trans-exclusionary feminist.	2019-12-19	truthorfiction	Kim LaCapria	Did J.K. Rowling ‘Confirm Her Stance Against Transgender Women’? Claim Author J.K. Rowling confirmed that she is a trans-exclusionary feminist. Rating True Like this fact check? Reporting Rumors that author J.K. Rowling (of the popular Harry Potter series) was a trans-exclusionary feminist circulated for years due to her comments and behavior on Twitter, culminating in a viral June 2019 Medium piece by Phalen Fairchild titled, JK Rowling Confirms Stance Against Transgender Women. In it, Fairchild observed that Rowling had a history of excluding transgender people, citing the author’s tacit support for fellow trans-exclusionary radical feminists on social media platforms: It’s been a long time coming, but finally we have a definitive answer. JK Rowling is a TERF [trans-exclusionary radical feminist]. There have been multiple instances wherein the (in)famous Harry Potter author demonstrated solidarity with radical feminists who have waged a vicious smear campaign against transgender women. Once, she blamed liking anti-transgender statuses on Twitter as an error, dubbing it a Clumsy and Middle-Aged Moment. Despite fans catching the 53 year old in the act of putting her stamp of approval on trans hate once again, she thumbed her nose at the backlash. At the time, a different site fact-checked the claims , finding them to be false. Despite Fairchild’s citation of instances in which Rowling quietly voiced support for trans-exclusionary feminists, the analysis determined: It’s not clear what Rowling’s motivations or reasons were for the follows and likes highlighted by Fairchild and others, and it’s not clear what Rowling’s views are on trans issues. As such, the claim that she had confirmed [her] stance against transgender women was false on two grounds. First, Rowling had not herself made substantive public utterances about trans issues, so there was no clear stance to be confirmed, and second, even if there had been, Rowling’s following of Berns’ account in June 2019 would not constitute relevant reliable evidence, since it had several possible explanations. Florida is where wokes go to die... Please enable JavaScript Florida is where wokes go to die On December 19 2019, Rowling herself explained her views about transgender people via Twitter, tweeting in support of Maya Forstater, a tax expert who was fired for questioning government plans to allow people to identify their own gender: Ms Forstater was a visiting fellow at the Centre for Global Development (CGD), which is a think-tank based in London and Washington that campaigns against poverty. She was accused of using offensive and exclusionary language on Twitter for saying men cannot change into women. Her legal dispute against her former employer was seen as a test on whether a gender-critical view — that there are only two biological sexes — was a protected philosophical belief under the 2010 Equality Act . Judge James Tayler decided that Ms Forstater’s view was incompatible with human dignity and fundamental rights of others. If Ms Forstater had won the case it would have legally prevented employers from dismissing staff for expressing their view on LGBT+ rights, her lawyers said. In response, Rowling tweeted: Dress however you please. Call yourself whatever you like. Sleep with any consenting adult who’ll have you. Live your best life in peace and security. But force women out of their jobs for stating that sex is real? #IStandWithMaya #ThisIsNotADrill — J.K. Rowling (@jk_rowling) December 19, 2019 Rowling said: Dress however you please. Call yourself whatever you like. Sleep with any consenting adult who’ll have you. Live your best life in peace and security. But force women out of their jobs for stating that sex is real? #IStandWithMaya #ThisIsNotADrill In short, the claim that J.K. Rowling confirmed her stance that transgender women are not women was true — Rowling did so tacitly prior to the June 2019 article, but openly affirmed those views on December 19 2019.

Claim Beauty YouTuber James Charles sent a DM calling another user the n-word. Rating Not True Like this fact check? Reporting Late on March 12 2019, a Twitter user shared a link (archived here ) to an unavailable tweet and claimed that beauty YouTuber James Charles called them a racial slur: In a follow up tweet (archived here ), the user reiterated the claim. Those images continued circulating into the morning of the following day, and users described Charles as a massive racist based on the screenshots. The account @KEEMSTAR shared one screenshot (archived here ) with a purported response from Charles: In that image, Charles appeared to respond in a since-deleted tweet: this is absolutely not funny, delete this immediately or my lawyer will be in contact Florida is where wokes go to die... Please enable JavaScript Florida is where wokes go to die A Reddit thread on r/BeautyGuruChatter noted that the screenshot was definitely fabricated, and the ensuing discussion centered around the adverse effects claims of racism could have on a YouTube celebrity’s career. Gossip site HollywoodLife recapped the controversy, referencing the response from Charles and describing the screenshot as fake: Jovan Hill’s latest Twitter joke isn’t sitting too well with his victim, James Charles! James freaked over the fake message Jovan posted to his page, and fans are trolling him for the reaction. James Charles was the butt of Jovan Hill’s latest joke, and he wasn’t thrilled about it! Jovan, an Internet star who makes money by pleading for his viewers to donate to him, posted a fake screenshot of his Instagram DMs on March 12, with an unopened ‘message’ from James sitting at the top. The fake message read ‘n***er,’ and Jovan shared the screenshot on Twitter with a question mark emoji. It wasn’t long before James caught wind of the prank, and he responded, This is absolutely not funny, delete this immediately or my lawyer will be in contact. Of course, James is right — it’s not funny — but Twitter still mocked him for threatening legal action over it. In subsequent tweets, the user referenced Charles’ lawyer comment. In those tweets, they said they knew the law, implying that the screenshots were parody , and bragged about leveraging the joke for social media traction. Their reference to laws about parody in response to mentions of a defamation claim further show that the screenshots were not legitimate. Although many users were clearly aware the screenshots of purported James Charles direct messages involving a racial slur were inauthentic, many more saw the images decoupled from their source and did not realize that the fabricated screen captures were a joke or parody. The latter term was used by the account responsible for the claim after Charles referenced legal action in response to the fake images.

Claim Amazon founder Jeff Bezos was building another mansion with elevators and 25 bathrooms at the same time part-time Whole Foods employees lost health benefits. Rating True Like this fact check? Reporting On November 4 2019, former United States Labor Secretary Robert Reich tweeted that Jeff Bezos was building a mansion in Washington, DC — while at the same time, part-time Whole Foods workers lost their health benefits: Jeff Bezos' D.C. mansion will have: — 2 elevators — 25 bathrooms — 1,006 light fixtures — A full movie theater Amazon's Whole Foods cut health benefits for part-time workers less than 2 months ago. Tax the rich. — Robert Reich (@RBReich) November 4, 2019 The tweet made a popular appearance on Reddit’s r/worldpolitics, in a thread titled Tax The Rich!!: Florida is where wokes go to die... Please enable JavaScript Florida is where wokes go to die Tax The Rich!! from worldpolitics According to Reich’s tweet, Bezos’ mansion in Washington, DC would feature 25 bathrooms, two separate elevators, a movie theater, and more than a thousand light fixtures (1,006, to be precise.) Reich added that Amazon’s Whole Foods had also recently discontinued health benefits for part-time workers. Reich describes Whole Foods as Amazon’s. In June 2017, Amazon acquired the Whole Foods chain of supermarkets for $13.7 billion. Amazon, of which Bezos is founder and CEO, became the parent company of Whole Foods in August 2017. An August 24 2017 statement issued by Amazon about the acquisition only mentions employees in a subsection at the bottom . In that mention, Amazon noted the possibility of difficulty maintaining relationships with employees, customers, and suppliers: Cautionary Statement Regarding Amazon Forward-Looking Statements This [press release] contains forward-looking statements. We use words such as anticipates, believes, expects, future, intends, and similar expressions to identify forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those projected or forecast in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially include the following: factors that could affect the timing of the consummation of Amazon’s acquisition of Whole Foods Market; Amazon may be unable to achieve the anticipated benefits of the transaction; revenues following the transaction may be lower than expected; operating costs, customer loss, and business disruption (including, without limitation, difficulties in maintaining relationships with employees, customers, and suppliers) may be greater than expected ; Amazon may assume unexpected risks and liabilities; initiatives with Whole Foods Market may distract Amazon’s management from other operations; and the other factors discussed in Risk Factors in Amazon’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016 and in Amazon’s other filings with the SEC, which are available at http://www.sec.gov. Amazon assumes no obligation to update the information in this communication, except as otherwise required by law. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements that speak only as of the date hereof. Prior to Amazon’s acquisition of Whole Foods in August 2017, the chain reported declining revenues and planned store closings. As of January 2019, Amazon was reported to be looking at former Sears and KMart stores as possible new Whole Foods locations. On September 12 2019, Amazon confirmed that it was rescinding healthcare benefits for its part-time employees as of January 1 2020, in order to better meet the needs of our business and create a more equitable and efficient scheduling model. That translates to part-time employees needing to work ten more hours a week than before in order to qualify for its healthcare plan: Amazon-owned Whole Foods will be withdrawing medical benefits for hundreds of its part-time workers starting Jan. 1, 2020, the company said Thursday. In the past, employees needed to work at least 20 hours a week to buy into the health-care plan. Now they will need to work at least 30 hours. Less than 2% of its workforce, or 1,900 employees, will no longer be eligible for medical coverage, under the new policy, the company said. [...] In order to better meet the needs of our business and create a more equitable and efficient scheduling model, we are moving to a single-tier part-time structure, a company spokesperson said in an email. We are providing Team Members with resources to find alternative healthcare coverage options, or to explore full-time, healthcare-eligible positions starting at 30 hours per week. All Whole Foods Market Team Members continue to receive employment benefits including a 20% in-store discount. In addition to information to help affected employees explore full-time open positions, a spokesperson said the company would provide them with resources to find alternative healthcare coverage options, presumably government subsidized health insurance through a public exchange. Although healthcare benefits were withdrawn, the company added: All Whole Foods Market Team Members continue to receive employment benefits including a 20% in-store discount. At the time the news was reported, United Food and Commercial Workers (UFCW) International President Marc Perrone said Amazon’s acquisition of Whole Foods involved efforts to devalue and degrade grocery jobs at the chain. Perrone lamented the need for workers to take more than one job in order to provide for their families: Amazon’s plan to cut health care for these part-time employees is one of Jeff Bezos’ most brazen attacks on the quality of jobs at Whole Foods and the communities they support. Too many workers today are already working two to three jobs just to get the hours and benefits they need, and these cuts by Jeff Bezos just made it harder for them ... Grocery jobs should be good jobs, and one job should be enough to provide for yourself and your family. It is true that as founder and chief executive officer of Amazon, Bezos’ company acquired Whole Foods as a subsidiary. It is further true that Whole Foods confirmed that it would stop offering healthcare benefits to some part-time workers as of January 1 2020. As for Bezos’ Washington, DC mansion and its 2 elevators, 25 bathrooms, 1,006 light fixtures and a full movie theater, Washingtonian reported in an April 2019 item titled Here Are the Floor Plans for Jeff Bezos’ $23 Million DC Home: Jeff Bezos has been quietly jetting into Washington over the past few years, becoming quite the hobnobber around town ... Soon, Washingtonians may see even more of him. In 2016, the Amazon founder and Washington Post owner paid $23 million in cash for the former Textile Museum in Kalorama (yes, his neighbors are the Obamas and Kushner-Trumps). At 27,000 square feet, the mansion was already the biggest home in Washington before he began a $12 million renovation and expansion last year ... Overseen by the Barnes Vanze architecture firm, the reno project covers 191 doors (many either custom mahogany or bronze), 25 bathrooms, 11 bedrooms, five living rooms/lounges, five staircases, three kitchens, two libraries/studies, two workout rooms, two elevators—and a huge ballroom. Washingtonian included details that likely didn’t fit into a single tweet: According to the documents, the Pope’s four stories will serve primarily as the family’s residence, with all the essentials for a tech-titan billionaire. The lower level (pictured below) has the main living quarters. Note the big whiskey cellar with plentiful drying racks (upper left) and the walk-in wine room (center). There’s also a large lounge complete with a bar, a family kitchen, and an elevator. On the same day as Reich’s tweet, Washingtonian published an update to their coverage, in which the movie theater is mentioned: ... updated plans included substantial work on the foundations of both buildings [of the mansion], including underpinning the walls and resetting the basement slab for the entire Pope House—a likely necessity, [consulting expert Bill] Mulholland surmised, if one is to transform a century-old cellar to accommodate such minor tweaks as an entertainment kitchen, full-scale lounge and whiskey and wine cellars. ( The Wood’s slab was reset in the northwest corner, directly below a Media Room that calls for tiered seating, implying a movie theater. ) As noted, architectural plans for Bezos’ DC mansion were obtained via a Freedom of Information Act request, not disclosed by Bezos or his representatives: So when is move-in day? Bezos isn’t saying. (A spokesperson for Amazon declined to comment, as well as architect Ankie Barnes, who cited a wish to respect our clients’ privacy) By all accounts, though, he is anxious to make landfall. One person described how they understood the timeline for installations over the summer. Jeff wanted that done immediately—I mean immediately. Like, ‘Fast, fast fast!’ they said. In June 2019, Business Insider reported that Bezos was expected to close a deal which included three adjacent Manhattan properties, at an estimated cost of $80 million. A February 2018 article from a separate outlet noted Bezos also owned homes in Washington State, Texas, and California (with two apparent residences in Beverly Hills.) In sum, Reich’s tweet held: Jeff Bezos is the founder and CEO of Amazon.com; Amazon acquired Whole Foods; Whole Foods rescinded healthcare benefits from part-time employees in 2019; Jeff Bezos’ new mansion in Washington DC has 2 elevators — 25 bathrooms — 1,006 light fixtures — [and a] full movie theater. In August 2017 Bezos’ Amazon.com acquired Whole Foods for $13.7 billion, and as of January 2019 sought to expand the chain to new locations. In April 2019, Washingtonian acquired blueprints and planning information for Bezos’ mansion in Washington DC. In early September 2019, a spokesperson for Amazon/Whole Foods acknowledge the company was ceasing to provide healthcare benefits to part-time employees of Whole Foods. And on November 4 2019, Washingtonian revisited the coverage of Bezos’ mansion and its construction to note that in addition to the 25 bathrooms and two elevators, plans indicated a likely movie theater with tiered seating. Reich packed a tremendous amount of detail into a short tweet, all of it essentially accurate.

Claim In response to a no one should live in a closet tattoo tweet, JK Rowling responded, Yes they should. Rating Not True Like this fact check? Reporting On January 25 2020, Twitter user @iknownaama tweeted the following image, a purported screenshot of JK Rowling reacting to a pro-LGBT tattoo (no one should live in a closet) by saying yes they should: https://twitter.com/iknownaama/status/1221239541983518720 In the tweet, @iknownaama wrote: so did the simulation glitch or does JK Rowling genuinely never think twice about what comes out of her mouth An image with the tweet showed a pride rainbow-colored set of eyeglasses, and the words no one should live in a closet. The tattoo’s text was rendered in a font associated with the Harry Potter series known as Lumos. No one should live in a closet had a double meaning in the context of the tattoo. In Harry Potter books and films, the titular character lives with Muggle family members, but instead of a bedroom, is confined to a closet — the cupboard under the stairs: The Cupboard Under the Stairs was Harry Potter’s room in the Dursley household until he was given Dudley Dursley’s old room, at 4 Privet Drive in Little Whinging, Surrey. The cupboard was described as small and dusty, with lots of spiders. Florida is where wokes go to die... Please enable JavaScript Florida is where wokes go to die To be in the closet or be closeted is also a widely-used metaphor for LGBTQ people forced not to identify as such: A person who is hiding the fact that they [sic] are gay has been described as in the closet, or as a closet homosexual, since the late 1960s. To out someone, meaning to reveal that they [sic] are gay, is a shortened way of saying to force them out of the closet. Closet comes from close, which both in the sense near and shut goes back to Latin claudere to shut, also the source of recluse, someone who shuts themselves [sic] away. As such, the tattoo referenced Potter’s closeted nature as a wizard with his non-magical relatives, likening it to scenarios wherein a LGBT person is closeted. Rainbows are sometimes a symbol for gay pride, and the imagery together decries closeting of one’s nature. Roughly a month prior to the January 25 2020 tweet above, Rowling caused international controversy with the following tweet : Dress however you please. Call yourself whatever you like. Sleep with any consenting adult who’ll have you. Live your best life in peace and security. But force women out of their jobs for stating that sex is real? #IStandWithMaya #ThisIsNotADrill — J.K. Rowling (@jk_rowling) December 19, 2019 On December 19 2019, Rowling expressed her support for an anti-transgender position, using a popular anti-trans hashtag — #ThisIsNotADrill. Rowling’s full-throated embrace of those viewpoints upset and disappointed many of her fans, particularly LGBTQ adults who grew up reading the series of books and watching the film adaptations. Even the first tweet initially caused some confusion about whether it was real and what it meant, matters that we addressed on our page about the tweet and controversy . Based on the abnormally high share count on the no one should live in a closet/yes they should tweet, users were similarly confused about whether Rowling made the comment shown. Typing @jk_rowling (her Twitter handle) into the search bar immediately populated yes they should afterwards, indicating users were searching for evidence of the tweet with frequency. Rowling had a high follower count and tweeted infrequently; one of her most recent tweets caused a frenzy of news articles worldwide. Readers also referenced the tweet as if it were self-evidently authentic: Ok but Harry only lived in a closet bc of his abusive family. So it’s still not good to say yes they should — Nic (@thatARTSYb1tch) January 26, 2020 @jk_rowling literally means yes they should live in closet like Harry Potter. Not metaphorically don't go out of the closet or don't come out. I don't know what worse, JKRowling not realizing the metaphor or these people that didn't get the joke and quickly attack JK. 🤦🏻‍♀️ — Z (@khaleesizelle) January 27, 2020 In the end, the tweet was clearly fake for a number of reasons: Interest in Rowling’s positions on LGBTQ issues escalated after her controversial December 2019 statements; statements appearing to extend to other portions of the LGBTQ community would certainly generate another spate of articles; Only one screenshot of the tweet seemed to exist; if it were authentic, it was likely many people would have captured proof before it was presumably deleted; We found no residue on Twitter of anyone manually retweeting the tweet nor of anyone engaging in significant discourse away from the viral screenshot on Twitter. A yes they should tweet attributed to JK Rowling (@jk_rowling) in response to a nobody should have to live in a closet tattoo was fabricated, but the intent behind that fake screenshot was unclear. Although it was possible someone sought to attribute the commentary to Rowling, it was just as likely a satirization of her actual, admitted opinions about transgender women. Nevertheless, Rowling did not tweet yes they should as depicted in the image.

44753				other				fullfact		https://fullfact.org/economy/how-many-jobs-are-supported-uks-oil-and-gas-industry/	The UK oil and gas industry supports an estimated 375,000 jobs.	2015-10-12	fullfact	Amy Sippitt	The UK oil and gas industry supports an estimated 375,000 jobs. 375,000 is the latest estimate of the total employment supported by the industry according to the industry itself. The oil and gas industry supports more than 400,000 jobs. Over 400,000 was an older estimate. These figures are uncertain, and don't just include people directly employed by the industry. Full Fact will be factchecking claims related to the Energy Bill as it passes through Parliament, thanks to a reader who started an independent crowdfunding campaign, and everyone who donated to it. Find out more. ...the oil and gas industry in the United Kingdom supports an estimated 375,000 jobs. Lord Bourne, 22 July 2015. ...it is important to recognise that the North Sea supports hundreds of thousands of jobs—more than 400,000. Lord Grantchester, 22 July 2015. Peers have noted the important contribution of the oil and gas industry to jobs in their discussions of the Energy Bill, but there was some confusion over how many were supported by the industry. 375,000 is the most recent estimate of jobs supported by the industry, calculated by Oil & Gas UK. Over 400,000 was its estimate at the start of 2014. These figures don't just refer to the total number of people directly employed by the industry. They include those whose jobs it says are in the wider supply chain, or exist because of oil and gas employees spending the money the sector pays them. About 40,000 people are directly employed in the industry. So claiming that the industry employs 375,000 people—as one other peer did in the debate—is incorrect. They're quite uncertain estimates, and don't account for newer figures on direct employment in the industry that were published last month. 375,000 is the latest estimate At the start of 2014, it was estimated that 440,000 jobs (or strictly, employment) were supported by the oil and gas industry, according to the representative body Oil & Gas UK. The organisation has estimated that there will be a 15% reduction in employment by the end of this year, taking the total estimate for employment linked to the industry to 375,000. It puts the decline down to companies seeking to cut costs (in the face of lower prices and declining investment), as well as making efficiency improvements. Those figures include direct, indirect and induced employment—so it's a broad definition of the employment resulting from the sector. Indirect employment counts people working in the supply chain resulting from oil and gas sector activity, where the extraction of oil and gas is one part of a wider business. Induced employment counts employment resulting from the redistribution of income from the oil and gas sector. This effectively means jobs that are created as a result of oil and gas employees spending their wages. Measuring these employment effects is tricky. Oil & Gas UK has pointed out that calculating a precise measure of employment has inherent uncertainties, due in part to the cyclical nature of the industry. Oil and Gas UK also says that redundancies may not always lead to a net loss of jobs, as some people may move to other roles or find work elsewhere. Newer figures for direct employment The 15% is based on the estimated 5,500 direct job losses announced publicly to June 2015, taken as a proportion of the ONS estimate of 36,600 people directly employed in the sector in 2013. This includes people where the main activity in their business was the extraction of oil or gas or support activities for extraction. Oil & Gas UK says it assumed the same decline across indirect and induced employment as well, leading it to the 375,000 estimate by the end of 2015. It's unclear to what extent the same decline would be seen across all types of employment—Oil & Gas UK told us lower activity would simply mean lower employment across the board. Since Oil & Gas UK's estimates were published, the ONS has released new provisional figures, which show about 41,700 people directly employed in oil and gas extraction or support services in 2014.

The oil and gas industry supports more than 400,000 jobs. Over 400,000 was an older estimate. These figures are uncertain, and don't just include people directly employed by the industry. Full Fact will be factchecking claims related to the Energy Bill as it passes through Parliament, thanks to a reader who started an independent crowdfunding campaign, and everyone who donated to it. Find out more. ...the oil and gas industry in the United Kingdom supports an estimated 375,000 jobs. Lord Bourne, 22 July 2015. ...it is important to recognise that the North Sea supports hundreds of thousands of jobs—more than 400,000. Lord Grantchester, 22 July 2015. Peers have noted the important contribution of the oil and gas industry to jobs in their discussions of the Energy Bill, but there was some confusion over how many were supported by the industry. 375,000 is the most recent estimate of jobs supported by the industry, calculated by Oil & Gas UK. Over 400,000 was its estimate at the start of 2014. These figures don't just refer to the total number of people directly employed by the industry. They include those whose jobs it says are in the wider supply chain, or exist because of oil and gas employees spending the money the sector pays them. About 40,000 people are directly employed in the industry. So claiming that the industry employs 375,000 people—as one other peer did in the debate—is incorrect. They're quite uncertain estimates, and don't account for newer figures on direct employment in the industry that were published last month. 375,000 is the latest estimate At the start of 2014, it was estimated that 440,000 jobs (or strictly, employment) were supported by the oil and gas industry, according to the representative body Oil & Gas UK. The organisation has estimated that there will be a 15% reduction in employment by the end of this year, taking the total estimate for employment linked to the industry to 375,000. It puts the decline down to companies seeking to cut costs (in the face of lower prices and declining investment), as well as making efficiency improvements. Those figures include direct, indirect and induced employment—so it's a broad definition of the employment resulting from the sector. Indirect employment counts people working in the supply chain resulting from oil and gas sector activity, where the extraction of oil and gas is one part of a wider business. Induced employment counts employment resulting from the redistribution of income from the oil and gas sector. This effectively means jobs that are created as a result of oil and gas employees spending their wages. Measuring these employment effects is tricky. Oil & Gas UK has pointed out that calculating a precise measure of employment has inherent uncertainties, due in part to the cyclical nature of the industry. Oil and Gas UK also says that redundancies may not always lead to a net loss of jobs, as some people may move to other roles or find work elsewhere. Newer figures for direct employment The 15% is based on the estimated 5,500 direct job losses announced publicly to June 2015, taken as a proportion of the ONS estimate of 36,600 people directly employed in the sector in 2013. This includes people where the main activity in their business was the extraction of oil or gas or support activities for extraction. Oil & Gas UK says it assumed the same decline across indirect and induced employment as well, leading it to the 375,000 estimate by the end of 2015. It's unclear to what extent the same decline would be seen across all types of employment—Oil & Gas UK told us lower activity would simply mean lower employment across the board. Since Oil & Gas UK's estimates were published, the ONS has released new provisional figures, which show about 41,700 people directly employed in oil and gas extraction or support services in 2014. So it's a bit higher than the estimate for 2013, but Oil & Gas UK told us it thought it wouldn't make that much of a difference to its estimate. The figure increases to 47,400 if you include people employed in the manufacture of oil products.

There were about 11,000 people directly employed by onshore wind and 8,000 in 'supply chain' roles in 2013, according to government estimates. It's uncertain how many people will see their employment threatened by the closure of the Renewables Obligation Full Fact will be factchecking claims related to the Energy Bill as it passes through Parliament, thanks to a reader who started an independent crowdfunding campaign, and everyone who donated to it. Find out more. These changes to the financial support for onshore wind threaten the future of 19,000 jobs supported by that sector. Lord Grantchester, 22 July 2015 The Labour peer Lord Grantchester has suggested that closing financial support to onshore wind (in the form of the Renewables Obligation (RO) a year earlier than planned could threaten 19,000 jobs supported by the industry. While an amendment has removed that part of the energy bill for now, the government has told us it intends to reintroduce it in the Commons. The 19,000 figure comes from 2013. It breaks down into 11,000 people directly employed by onshore wind, and 8,000 people employed in 'supply chain' roles. It's not easy to tell how many of these people would have their employment threatened by the changes. 19,000 people were thought to be employed in roles supported by the sector in 2013 There were 11,000 people directly employed in the UK's onshore wind sector in 2013, with another 8,000 people employed in roles supplying goods (such as electrical cables) and services to the sector, according to a report commissioned by the Department of Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS) published earlier this year. We don't know what effect closing the Renewables Obligation would have on employment Jobs associated with onshore wind aren't all permanent; some of them are associated with the construction of projects, and others with their operation and maintenance once built. To the extent that certain projects may not proceed as a result of the early RO closure, jobs may be impacted. The government's impact assessment notes that the changes could lead to a reduction in the number of people employed in the onshore wind sector, but that the net impact on GB-wide employment is uncertain. The government's best estimate is that roughly 200 megawatts worth of windfarm capacity that would have been built by 2020 won't be if the Renewables Obligation closes early, although the reduction in capacity built could be anywhere between 0-2,500 megawatts. It is not possible to translate this figure directly into jobs on the basis of the BIS data. Different projects would feel different effects Jobs associated with wind farms that are already up and running under the Renewables Obligation are unlikely to be affected; the Department of Energy and Climate Change has confirmed to us that existing schemes will continue to receive support. But jobs associated with the construction of new projects could be threatened, including roles in the supply chain. In the short term, if projects are cancelled, then construction work that would have been associated with these projects won't go ahead. In the longer run, jobs associated with the maintenance and operation of these projects won't materialise. The grace period could mitigate some impacts The government's plans for closure of the RO (before they were rejected in the Lords) would have affected projects that would have qualified for the scheme between April 2016 and 2017 (when the renewables obligation would have closed to all new projects anyway). There might have been some exceptions; the government proposed a grace period for projects that had planning consent by the 18th of June 2015, so exactly how the early closure would have affected them isn't clear. If these projects progress as originally planned, then there would be no net impact on jobs for these projects. Projects—and jobs related to them—which had started but not gained planning permission by this date would be affected. We don't know if these proposals will change when the government re-introduces its plans.	http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2014/2388/pdfs/uksi_20142388_en.pdf:-:http://www.parliament.uk/documents/impact-assessments/IA15-007D.pdf:-:http://www.parliament.uk/documents/impact-assessments/IA15-007D.pdf#page=17:-:http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld201516/ldhansrd/text/150722-0001.htm:-:http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld201516/ldhansrd/text/151021-0001.htm#column_688:-:https://www.fullfact.org../../../../economy/energy_bill:-:https://www.fullfact.org/economy/are-we-missing-our-targets-renewable-energy/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content:-:https://www.fullfact.org/economy/how-much-will-closing-renewables-obligation-early-save-your-bills/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content:-:https://www.fullfact.org/economy/proposed-renewables-obligation-cut-how-much-onshore-wind-capacity-loses-out/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content:-:https://www.fullfact.org/economy/what-do-brits-think-about-wind-farms/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content:-:https://www.fullfact.org/economy/would-early-closure-renewables-obligation-onshore-wind-cost-100-million/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content:-:https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/2010-to-2015-government-policy-low-carbon-technologies/2010-to-2015-government-policy-low-carbon-technologies#appendix-5-the-renewables-obligation-ro:-:https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/renewables-obligation-ro-grace-period-for-new-onshore-wind/government-amendments-to-the-energy-bill-2015-onshore-wind:-:https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/renewables-obligation-ro-grace-period-for-new-onshore-wind/information-on-the-proposed-ro-grace-period-for-new-onshore-wind:-:https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/416240/bis-15-206-size-and-performance-of-uk-low-carbon-economy.pdf#page=64:-:https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/416240/bis-15-206-size-and-performance-of-uk-low-carbon-economy.pdf#page=80	How many jobs could be lost in onshore wind?

Media reports show that at least some individual nurses and trainees have visited food banks. We don’t have solid evidence of the scale of use. We can be a country where we don't need to have nurses going to food banks any more. Emily Thornberry MP, 11 May 2017 Media reports have found specific cases of practising or trainee nurses using food banks. But we’ve not found any research into how widespread this is. The Royal College of Nursing (RCN) has reported growing numbers of nursing staff using food banks, taking on additional jobs and accruing personal debt. It told us that: We have a network of reps and RCN officers that stretches across the UK. They are in constant contact with members and this is what they report. This is not just one or two cases. We also spoke to the Trussell Trust, the largest food bank network in the UK, which told us that the people who use its services aren’t asked what job they have. So we don’t know how many nurses are being referred to it. But the Trust did say that it had occasional reports from [its] foodbanks of nurses being referred for emergency food. According to a press release the RCN Foundation awarded over 500 financial hardship grants to working, retired, trainee, or unemployed nurses, midwives and healthcare assistants in the UK in 2016. The Foundation says that one in four grants went to a full-time nurse. They largely cover cost of living expenses, but from the press release it’s hard to say whether many were given to put food in people’s mouths. RCN also says that 6,500 trainee nurses were awarded hardship grants from their universities over the last three years, although we haven’t been able to check these figures in detail.	http://journals.rcni.com/doi/pdfplus/10.7748/ns.30.43.3.s1:-:http://researchbriefings.parliament.uk/ResearchBriefing/Summary/SN06657:-:http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b08qfq5b/question-time-edinburgh:-:http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/as-a-nurse-i-see-my-colleagues-go-to-food-banks-because-of-low-pay-without-corbyns-nhs-policies-our-a7209196.html:-:http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/trainee-nurses-depend-food-banks-8386405:-:https://www.buzzfeed.com/laurasilver/a-nurse-using-a-food-bank-to-feed-her-family-says-jeremy?utm_term=.teqpB0KrP#.xwn485WMP:-:https://www.fullfact.org/economy/express-cptpp-exports/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content:-:https://www.fullfact.org/economy/how-many-people-use-food-banks/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content:-:https://www.fullfact.org/economy/uk-france-pension-comparisons/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content:-:https://www.fullfact.org/economy/zarah-sultana-jeff-bezos-amazon-90000/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content:-:https://www.fullfact.org/health/are-there-more-nurses-our-wards/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content:-:https://www.rcn.org.uk/get-help/member-support-services/lamplight/guide-to-financial-assistance:-:https://www2.rcn.org.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0003/649920/RCN-evidence-to-the-NHS-PRB-201617.pdf	How many nurses are using foodbanks?

The number of uses of Trussell Trust food banks has increased over this period from 41,000 to 1.2 million, but we don’t know how many individual people use food banks in total. The Trust estimates it had 560,000 users in 2016/17, but this won’t reflect the total number of people using food banks in the UK. Since, I think 2010, the number of people relying on food banks has gone up from the tens of thousands to the millions. BBC Question Time audience member, 27 April 2017 The number of uses of Trussell Trust food banks has gone up by this much, but we don’t actually know how many unique individuals rely on them. The Trussell Trust is the largest food bank network in the UK, and it handed out around 41,000 food packs in 2009/10 compared to 1.2 million in 2016/17. But some people will use a food bank more than once. The Trust says that the average person using a food bank will do so twice in a year, so it estimates that around 590,000 different people used its services in 2016/17. A 2014 estimate suggested that the Trussell Trust’s food banks account for around half (420) of the food banks in the UK. That suggests the actual number of food parcels handed out across the UK, and the number of users of food banks, will be higher. The number of food banks has also increased since 2010 so more people have access to a food bank now. That means we can’t be sure that the increasing use of food banks is due to increasing demand. It may be that demand has stayed the same but there are now more services available for people to use. We’re looking into the research that’s been done on this.	http://researchbriefings.parliament.uk/ResearchBriefing/Summary/SN06657:-:http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b08p1v2s/question-time-27042017:-:https://foodpovertyinquiry.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/food-poverty-appg-evidence-review-final.pdf#page=8:-:https://www.fullfact.org/economy/express-cptpp-exports/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content:-:https://www.fullfact.org/economy/how-many-nurses-are-using-foodbanks/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content:-:https://www.fullfact.org/economy/levelling-up-funding-2023/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content:-:https://www.fullfact.org/economy/uk-france-pension-comparisons/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content:-:https://www.fullfact.org/economy/zarah-sultana-jeff-bezos-amazon-90000/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content:-:https://www.trusselltrust.org/2017/04/25/uk-foodbank-use-continues-rise/:-:https://www.trusselltrust.org/news-and-blog/latest-stats/end-year-stats/	How many people use food banks?

Incorrect, it was actually 68%, which refers to people on the contracts who’ve specified a view of their hours. It’s 57% if you include people who didn’t specify a view.Newer official figures put the same figures at around 72% and 63% respectively. Matthew Taylor wrote a very good report on this. He discovered that 58% of people working on zero-hours contracts do not want more hours, it suits their lives, they have flexible lives. Rory Stewart MP, 13 September 2018 Mr Stewart is referring to the Taylor Review into modern working practices led by Matthew Taylor, Chief Executive of the Royal Society of Arts, in 2017. It said that 68% of people in the UK on zero hours contracts didn’t want more hours, rather than 58% as Mr Stewart claimed. The figures in the report were from the Labour Force Survey published by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) in March 2017. It found that 68% of people on zero hours contracts between October and December 2016 who specified a view said they didn’t want more hours. Out of everyone on the contracts (including those who didn’t say what they wanted), 57% didn’t want more hours. Stay informed Be first in line for the facts – get our free weekly email Subscribe Newer figures are available from the ONS covering the period from April to June 2018. They show that 72% of people on a zero hours contract expressing a preference said they didn’t want more hours, or 63% of everyone on the contracts (including the unknowns). The average person on a zero hours contract in mid-2018 usually worked about 25 hours per week, compared to an average of 36 hours for everyone in employment. There were estimated to be around 780,000 people employed on zero hours contracts as their main job between April and June 2018. That’s roughly 2.4% of people in employment, or about one in 40 workers. This includes contracts explicitly called zero hours, but also arrangements with different labels such as ‘casual contracts’ or 'hours to be notified'. In November 2017 there were estimated to be around 1.8 million contracts that did not guarantee a minimum number of hours, where work had actually been carried out under those contracts. Neither measure is perfect, so we use both to get a better overview of how zero hours contracts are used. It’s also difficult to get comparisons of zero hours contracts over time, increases in the number of people on zero hours contracts between 2011 and 2016 were likely to have been affected by greater awareness and recognition of the term zero-hours contract, according to the ONS. This upwards trend in the numbers has reversed more recently.

44759				other				fullfact		https://fullfact.org/economy/how-many-retail-jobs-have-been-lost-year/	50,000 retail jobs were axed in the first half of this year.	2018-07-04	fullfact	Abbas Panjwani	50,000 retail jobs were axed in the first half of this year. This refers to businesses in all sectors who publicly announced job losses. Over the long term the number of UK retail jobs appear stable, but jobs in other sectors are growing. A staggering 50,000 retail jobs were axed in the first half of this year. Daily Mail 2 July 2018. 50,000 people lost their jobs on the high street Daily Mirror, 2 July 2018 The claim of 50,000 retail jobs being lost in the first six months of 2018 comes from figures collected by the Press Association (PA) – they said they added up the total number of job losses publicly announced this calendar year. The data includes businesses in all sectors – not just retail, and doesn’t include those businesses that don’t publicly announce job losses. Data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) shows that retail jobs are seasonal, falling every spring and rising every winter, and that the drop in the first three months of this year was actually below average. Over the long term retail jobs are stable, though jobs in the rest of the economy as a whole are growing. Stay informed Be first in line for the facts – get our free weekly email Subscribe PA said they looked at companies that cut or announced cuts to jobs in the first half of 2018, and found that 50,000 jobs were axed. These figures were for companies across all sectors, not just retail companies; they included retail firms like Toys R Us, but also firms in other sectors like Prezzo and Carillion. Also, the PA’s data weren’t comprehensive as not all companies publicly announce job losses. Finally the estimate doesn’t factor in any jobs that were gained over the same period, whether in retail or elsewhere. To get an accurate and comprehensive picture of retail jobs numbers we can use data from the Office for National Statistics on workforce jobs. ONS data for the UK estimates that from the last three months of 2017 to the first three months of 2018, 84,000 fewer people were employed in retail. This data covers employees and self-employed people (99% of the total workforce), and the retail sector excludes people working in car or motorcycle garages. This data doesn’t cover the most recent quarter of 2018 (Q2) as the PA’s figures do, and doesn’t cover those job losses that have been announced but not yet occurred. Also the number of people in employment is slightly different from the number of jobs (e.g. one person in employment can have two jobs). But it does provide more accurate and useful data for understanding the health of the retail jobs market. One important thing the figures show is that retail jobs are seasonal and so looking at changes from quarter to quarter isn’t that helpful in terms of understanding the overall trend. The data also show that the estimates for retail job losses this year are similar to previous years. The data shows that since records began in 1997, there has always been fewer people employed in retail in the middle of the year compared to the end of the previous year. The drop of 84,000 is below average. There has also been a fall from Q4 to Q2 in every year, so the PA’s finding that retail jobs have fallen in the first half of this year is also true of every other year since records began. By looking at yearly averages, we can better understand the long term trend in retail jobs. The data estimates that the number of people employed in retail is relatively stable over the past few years but is not keeping pace with job growth in the rest of the economy. In summary, the falls we’ve seen so far this year do not mark 2018 out as a particularly bad year for retail employment – although those figures don’t yet account for the second three months of the year. But more broadly job growth in the retail sector has been lagging behind growth in other sectors over the past decade.

44760				other				fullfact		https://fullfact.org/economy/how-many-young-people-could-benefit-help-rent/	An estimated 2m young people in their 20s and 30s can't find the money needed to move out of their parent's home.	2015-04-14	fullfact	Helen Lock	An estimated 2m young people in their 20s and 30s can't find the money needed to move out of their parent's home. In 2013 there were 2.4m people between the age of 20 and 34 who both lived at home and had a job. Their specific reasons for not having moved out are not known though. around two million young working adults still live with their parents despite being in paid work. Nick Clegg, Liberal Democrat press release, 10 April 2015. The Liberal Democrats have proposed to make government loans available to young adults so they can cover the costs of a tenancy deposit and move out of their parent's homes. The 'Help to Rent' scheme would make government loans of up to £1500 (£2000 in London) available to 18-30 year-olds for tenancy deposits. To be eligible people must: be aged between 18-30; be in paid employment; not own their own property already; and not be applying to live in social housing. So how many people could potentially use the loan? In media coverage of the idea last week Nick Clegg was widely quoted as saying: I think the estimates are now about 2m people in their 20s and 30s — who simply can't find the money needed for a deposit to rent a flat or home of their own. Figures from the Office of National Statistics (ONS) show there were 3.3 million people aged 20-34 living with their parents in 2013 - that's 26% of that age group. Of those, 72% of them were employed, which is approximately 2.4 million people — so actually not far off the 'estimated 2m' that Clegg talks about. The latest ONS analysis on this is from 2013, so the numbers might have changed since then. The ONS results are presented for the 20-34 age range so slightly different to the 18-30 age group the policy is aimed at. Only 8% of people aged 30-34 were living at home in 2013. That compared to 49% of people aged 20 -24, and 21% of 25 to 29-year-olds. The claim and policy assumes that those young adults who live with their parents fit the description of not being able to afford deposits and wanting to move out, when neither could be the case. Still, the numbers of young people living at home, which had been increasing slightly, did rise after the recession, which suggests economic factors may have been at play when these figures were recorded (see table above). The Lib Dems also said the scheme would benefit the housing market too. Because they said parents would more readily move to smaller properties once their grown-up children had moved away. For context to this claim we have a factchecker's guide to housing issues.	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election-2015-32247255:-:http://www.libdems.org.uk/helping-young-adults-out-of-the-family-home-and-into-their-own-place:-:http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/family-demography/young-adults-living-with-parents/2013/sty-young-adults.html:-:http://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/apr/10/help-to-rent-scheme-for-young-people-proposed-by-liberal-democrats:-:https://www.fullfact.org../../../../economy/house_prices_housebuilding-41603:-:https://www.fullfact.org../../../../factcheck/economy/miliband_housing_rent_ownership-41549:-:https://www.fullfact.org/economy/express-cptpp-exports/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content:-:https://www.fullfact.org/economy/levelling-up-funding-2023/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content:-:https://www.fullfact.org/economy/maternity-pay-vs-leave/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content:-:https://www.fullfact.org/economy/uk-france-pension-comparisons/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content:-:https://www.fullfact.org/economy/zarah-sultana-jeff-bezos-amazon-90000/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content	How many young people could benefit from Help-to-Rent?

44761				other				fullfact		https://fullfact.org/economy/how-much-are-charities-spending-good-works/	Some charities are spending less than half of the money raised by members of the public on good works.	2015-12-15	fullfact	Sam Ashworth-Hayes	Some charities are spending less than half of the money raised by members of the public on good works. Looking at the ratio of charitable spending on total income doesn't tell us about how well-run a charity is. Charities sometimes have to spend money to make money, and may choose not to spend all of their income at once. Some of the UK's biggest and best known charities are spending less than half of the cash raised every year by members of the public on good works, a new research has found. The Telegraph, 12 December 2015 A report from the True and Fair Foundation lookingat charitable spending appeared in the Telegraph this weekend. The report looked at various charities' spending on charitable activities as a proportion of their total income, averaged over a three year period. Looking at the ratio of charitable spending to total income doesn't tell you much about how well-run charities are, or how effective they are at achieving their charitable goals. That's because charities sometimes have to spend money to make money—for example, paying rent for a charity shop. Looking at total income, as the report did, doesn't account for charities spending money to raise more money, or for situations when they don't spend all of their income at once. Sometimes you have to spend money to make money Charity accounts show all the resources that flow to a charity in a year, whether through donations, investments, or other sources. This doesn't account for the cost of generating that income. For instance, a charity might pay a fundraising team to help raise donations. This can lower the ratio of 'charitable activity' spending to total income. For example, a charity might get £50 in donations, and another £50 from its charity shop, which costs £30 to run. Its total income is £100. The charity spends £70 on charitable works, and £30 on running its shop. Criticising it for only spending 70% of its income on 'good works' wouldn't show the whole picture. If it hadn't spent £30 on the shop, it would only have £50 to spend on charitable activities. In this case, it would be more helpful to look at the amount of income leftover after the cost of generating it. Different organisations can have very different ratios purely as a result of how they raise their funding. It's also worth noting that some charities don't receive any funding from the general public. The report's methodology counts money that should probably be left out The ratio used in the report includes items of income that cannot always legally be spent, like permanent endowments. This is money or land that is given to a charity with the intention that it will be held forever. The ratio also includes income that isn't actually received in that year; legacies are recorded when a charity is notified that they've been left a sum in a will, but they aren't received until a person dies. Looking at short periods can be misleading Looking at the proportion over short periods raises another problem. If a charity receives an unusually large amount of money in one year, should it spend it over the three year period to meet a spending target, or should it invest it and spread spending over a longer period? By this particular ratio a charity would look better doing the first rather than the second. This is precisely what happened to one of the charities highlighted in the report. The Racing Foundation received a payment of almost £50 million from the Department for Culture, Media and Sport last year. Instead of spending the sum in one year, the charity placed the funds in investments, with the aim of preserving the capital over the long term and generating investment income to fund grant-making activities. Full Fact is a registered charity The comparable figure for Full Fact was about 92% in 2014. Our total income was £336,000 and we spent £309,000 on charitable activities.	http://apps.charitycommission.gov.uk/Accounts/Ends97/0001145297_AC_20141231_E_C.PDF#page=10:-:http://www.charitysorp.org/media/620341/frsse_module-5.pdf:-:http://www.sayervincent.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/SORP2015MadeSimple-SayerVincent-July2015.pdf#page=4:-:http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/12046438/true-and-fair-foundation-hornets-nest-charity-report.html:-:http://www.trueandfairfoundation.com/content/file/feature/review-hornets-nest-report-into-charitable-spending-UK-charities-12-dec-15.pdf:-:https://www.fullfact.org/economy/express-cptpp-exports/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content:-:https://www.fullfact.org/economy/levelling-up-funding-2023/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content:-:https://www.fullfact.org/economy/maternity-pay-vs-leave/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content:-:https://www.fullfact.org/economy/uk-france-pension-comparisons/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content:-:https://www.fullfact.org/economy/zarah-sultana-jeff-bezos-amazon-90000/?utm_source=content_page&utm_medium=related_content:-:https://www.gov.uk/guidance/permanent-endowment-rules-for-charities	How much are charities spending on good works?

Verdict: False The footage is from a military-based simulation game. Fact Check: Three Russian airbases in Russia were targeted by Ukrainian drones, leading to the death of one pilot and the damage of two bombers, The New Voice of Ukraine reported. The Russian Air Force has suffered 64 visually confirmed aircraft damaged or destroyed since its invasion of Ukraine started in February, according to military analysis website Oryx . The Facebook video, viewed more than 14,000 times, claims to show 6 Russian MiG-35 aircraft in Ukraine.

Fact Check: The Russian Navy has suffered several defeats, including the loss of its Black Sea Fleet’s flagship, the Moskva, in April by Ukrainian Neptune anti-ship missiles, according to Forbes .

53703				misleading				checkyourfact	https://checkyourfact.com/author/JCas	https://checkyourfact.com/2022/12/16/fact-check-walmart-closing-theft/	A post shared on Facebook purports Walmart CEO Doug McMillon announced Walmart would be forced to close if theft rates continue.	2022-12-16	checkyourfact	Joseph Casieri	A post shared on Facebook purports Walmart CEO Doug McMillon announced Walmart would be forced to close if theft rates continue. Verdict: Misleading McMillon did not say the whole company was in danger of closing, but rather surging retail thefts could lead to specific store closures. Fact Check: Due to the rising inflation many families are expected to be spending less as Christmas approaches, CNN reported. Losses associated with retail theft have risen to $94.5 billion in 2021, up from $90.8 billion in 2020, according to Yahoo finance . The post purports that Walmart may close soon due to high rates of theft. The post does not give any information on where or when this was said, but features a Raphouse TV logo. Walmart CEO warns company will close if theft doesn’t slow down, the post reads. Walmart loses roughly $3 Billion in theft every year. The post got the attention of many, including celebrity Amber Rose. (RELATED: Did Elon Musk Publish This Tweet Saying He Would Be Deleting Twitter?) The claim is out of context. In an interview on CNBC , McMillon spoke on the issues of theft saying, theft is an issue, it’s higher than what it has historically been. McMillon commented broadly on the prosecutions of these crimes saying, if this is not corrected, over time prices will go higher and/or stores will close. McMillon was specifically referring to locations that have lax procedures to deal with shoplifting. There is no credible news report that suggests Walmart itself is at risk of closing the entire company over retail theft losses. The company has seen a rise in theft along with the rest of the retail industry. Some employees and customers have blamed the implementation of new self-checkout devices at stores for the increase, according to Business Insider . This is not the first time false misinformation has spread on social media.

Chuck Grassley demanded President Joe Biden resign from office.	2022-12-19	checkyourfact	Christine Sellers	A video shared on Facebook purports Iowa Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley demanded President Joe Biden resign from office. Verdict: False The video’s caption is inaccurate. A spokesperson for Grassley denied the senator called for Biden’s resignation in an email to Check Your Fact. Fact Check: Grassley filed re-election paperwork for the 2028 election in November, The Hill reported. Grassley also said Democrats should continue to hold the 2024 Caucuses in Iowa first despite potential changes from the Democratic National Committee in its nominating schedule, according to the Des Moines Register . The Facebook video, viewed over 3,000 times, purports Grassley called for Biden’s resignation. ‘IT IS A FRAUD’ Grassley DEMANDS Biden’s ‘resignation’ with ‘Hunter 2020 CHEAT’ evidence, the video’s caption reads. The claim is false. There are no credible news reports suggesting Grassley made such a remark. Likewise, the claim neither appears on Grassley’s website nor his verified social media accounts . The White House also has not publicly commented on the claim. The almost 10-minute video shows Grassley delivering a statement during an August 2022 Senate Judiciary Committee hearing focused on FBI oversight. (RELATED: Did Donald Trump Make These Comments Defending Kanye West?) In the original video, Grassley discusses various instances of alleged FBI oversight, including the agency’s handling of sexual abuse accusations made by U.S. gymnasts, vetting of Afghan refugees following the U.S. withdrawal from the country, and a rise in violent crime. Although Grassley suggests Biden’s Justice Department supposedly seems to be more concerned with intimidating parents who question what their children are being taught in school rather than violent crime, he does not call for the president’s resignation. Grassley also mentions the FBI’s investigation into Biden’s son, Hunter Biden, but makes no comment about 2020 cheat evidence. The post attributes words to Senator Grassley that he did not say, Grassley’s Press Secretary Aaron Britt told Check Your Fact in an email statement. Britt also directed Check Your Fact to the original video with Grassley’s full remarks. This is not the first time a video with an unrelated claim has circulated online.

Verdict: False An autopsy discovered that Wahl’s death was caused by an aortic aneurysm, but was unrelated to his vaccination status. Fact Check: Wahl was covering the World Cup in Qatar last weekend when he died from an aortic aneurysm, according to ESPN . The journalist’s death was the subject of much controversy, with some speculating that he had been murdered due to an article criticizing the Qatari government for immigrant deaths, The New York Times reported. A Facebook post claims Wahl’s death was caused by the COVID-19 vaccine. The post features several syringe emojis, a tweet and an article from the Daily Mail. Fully [vaccinated] sports journalist Grant Wahl #diedsuddenly of an Aortic aneurysm, the tweet reads. A known side effect caused by the Covid 19 Vaccine. His wife was part of the Covid 19 medical advisory board- both were VERY [pro-vaccination]. This tweet cited garnered over 900 retweets. There is no evidence for this claim, however.

Facebook/Screenshot Verdict: False According to a communication posted to Federal Reserve Bank Services.org, new Federal Reserve notes are currently in production. Fact Check: The Federal Reserve raised its benchmark interest rate up to between 4.25-4.5%, making it the highest rate in 15 years, according to BBC News . Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell hinted at more rate hikes next year to tackle inflation, Reuters reported. The Facebook video, shared 11,000 times, purports the Federal Reserve has suspended the availability of new currency. They are not printing any more of this paper money, the woman in the video said. The claim is false. There are no credible news reports suggesting the Federal Reserve has suspended the availability of new currency. Likewise, the claim is neither mentioned on the Federal Reserve’s website nor on its verified social media accounts . The U.S. Treasury Department also has not publicly commented on the purported claim. According to a communication posted to Federal Reserve Bank Services.org , a new series of Federal Reserve notes is currently in production. The communication indicates the new Federal Reserve notes will include Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and Treasurer Chief Marilynn Malerba’s signatures. In addition, the communication states paper currency remains a legally valid form of payment regardless of when it was issued.

Paper money is printed by the Treasury Department’s Bureau of Engraving and Printing, Investopedia notes. (RELATED: Will Dollar Bills Printed In 2021 Be Banned Starting January 2023?)

Verdict: False The claim stems from a satirical website. A spokesperson for the Navy Judge Advocate General’s (JAG) Corps said the statement was false. Fact Check: Zients partnered with White House Chief of Staff Ron Klain and former Deputy COVID-19 Response Coordinator Natalie Quillian in September 2022 to bring new members to Biden’s cabinet, according to Axios . Zients left his job as Biden’s COVID-19 Response Coordinator in March 2022, CNN reported. The Facebook post purports the U.S. military arrested Zients for treason and murder. The post claims Zients was purportedly intercepted by the JAG Corps and was allegedly informed that they would be sending him to Guantanamo Bay on charges related to the COVID-19 vaccine. The claim is false. There are no credible news reports suggesting the U.S. military arrested Zients for treason and murder. Likewise, the claim neither appears on the Navy JAG’s website nor its verified social media accounts . The White House also has not publicly commented on the claim. A keyword search reveals the claim stems from a Dec. 13 article published by the website Real Raw News. A disclaimer included on the site’s About Us page indicates it contains humor, parody, and satire. (RELATED: Did The U.S. JAG Corps Arrest Former Twitter Lawyer James Baker?) This is not true, Navy JAG spokesperson Devin Arneson said of the claim in an email to Check Your Fact. This is not the first time a satirical claim has circulated online.

Verdict: False The article appears to be digitally fabricated. There is no evidence that The Guardian posted any such story or that Musk made this comment. Fact Check: A poll posted by Musk on Twitter suggested a majority of users on the platform recommended he step down as CEO, according to CNN . Musk recently sold 22 million shares of Tesla Motors stock worth an estimated $3.6 Billion, CNBC reported. The post purports that audio of Musk has surfaced featuring a bizarre rant, claiming a plot to spread transgender ideals was ongoing and his son was stolen. The alleged tweet does not clarify how or when this audio was leaked. Leaked audio of Elon Musk ranting about a ‘subversive elite plot’ to ‘spread transgender ideology’ has caused outrage online, the post reads. In the rant, the tycoon, and world’s richest man, said that ‘Marxist scum’ stole his son, and that Musk would ‘use [his] wealth to destroy their agenda.’ This claim is baseless. There is no credible new report that suggests this Guardian story is authentic. This post appears on none of the Guardians verified social media accounts . No such news report appears on their website or on the archived version of the website from Dec.12, when the supposed story appeared. Musk’s daughter, Vivian Jenna Wilson, is transgender and opted to drop Musk while changing to her chosen name at 18, NBC reported. Musk has voiced his support for transgender peoples, but also voiced a dislike of the amount of different pronouns. The tape and quotes cited in the article do not appear on Musk’s account . I absolutely support trans, but all these pronouns are an esthetic nightmare — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) December 16, 2020 The screenshot shared has never been a published Guardian tweet or story, a spokesperson from The Guardian told Check Your Fact in an email.

But this is false, and the Marburg outbreak has nothing to do with Covid-19. We explore what Marburg virus is, where it’s been detected, and how it differs from Covid-19. False claims by unidentified ‘whistleblower’ The video begins with a clip from an August 2021 news segment about the first confirmed death due to Marburg virus disease (or MVD) in Guinea. The video then claims that We are moving to the next phase of the Global ‘Pandemic’. An unnamed man with an Irish accent, only identified as a whistleblower healthcare professional, then says that vaccines against Covid-19 will cause deaths that appear to be caused by MVD and will be falsely declared a Marburg pandemic. But this is inaccurate on a number of counts. Marburg virus disease very different to Covid-19, and not found in countries with high Covid vaccination rates MVD is an infectious disease caused by the Marburg virus. First discovered in 1967, the virus infects humans and other primates, but is also spread by Egyptian rousette bats . Marburg is most commonly found in East Africa, and the August 2021 case represents not only the first confirmed case of MVD in Guinea, but the first in West Africa. MVD initially causes fever, chills, and headaches, but symptoms slowly become more severe and include a rash, chest pain, nausea, vomiting and shock. Eventually liver failure, bleeding and multi-organ dysfunction sets in. The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) notes that MVD can be difficult to diagnose as its symptoms are easily confused with other diseases like malaria and Ebola. Guinea Marburg outbreak small, local, and not declared a pandemic A man in the West African country died on 2 August after first developing symptoms of MVD on 25 July. No other cases of the disease were found, though 172 people who had been in contact with the man were closely monitored for 21 days. This included 14 people who had been identified as being at high risk of contracting the disease. The outbreak was declared officially over 42 days after the man’s death, twice as long as it would take to develop symptoms after contracting MVD. Series of tests confirmed Marburg diagnosis The Guinean case initially tested negative for malaria. Following this, he was tested a total of three times for Marburg and twice for Ebola by laboratories in Guinea and neighbouring Senegal. These laboratory confirmations made it clear that his disease was caused by Marburg virus. Marburg is a filovirus , not a coronavirus like the one that causes Covid-19. Covid-19 has very different symptoms to MVD – the most common are fever, tiredness and dry cough. Covid-19 vaccines often cause side effects , but these are typically very mild, and last no longer than a few days. Covid-19 vaccines linked to extremely rare blood clots Some studies have found that Covid-19 vaccines may be linked to extremely rare but potentially dangerous blood clots. The man in the Facebook video mentions this but this rare side effect of the vaccine does not involve hemorrhaging, or excessive bleeding, which is associated with MVD and other hemorrhagic diseases. The vaccines have also not been found to present a serious risk of death or injury. A number of international health bodies, including the European Medicines Agency, declared the vaccines safe for use after investigating the risks. No incidence of Marburg in countries with high vaccination rates If the side effects of Covid-19 vaccines could be easily mistaken for MVD, it is extremely unlikely that this would have been misidentified in Guinea, and not in a country with higher rates of vaccination against Covid-19. As of 4 December 2021, months after the single MVD case, just under a million people in Guinea, around 7% of the population, had been fully vaccinated. In comparison, Canada had vaccinated nearly 29 million people, accounting for just over three quarters of its population. Canada and other countries with highly vaccinated populations have not experienced outbreaks of MVD. There is no evidence that the side effects of the Covid-19 vaccines are being hushed up under false rumours of a Marburg pandemic. And the symptoms of MVD and the reported side effects of Covid-19 vaccines are very different.	https://covid19.who.int/:-:https://sacoronavirus.co.za/faqs/:-:https://sacoronavirus.co.za/vaccine-updates/:-:https://www.afro.who.int/news/guinea-declares-end-marburg-virus-disease-outbreak:-:https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.05.19.444882v2:-:https://www.cdc.gov/:-:https://www.cdc.gov/vhf/marburg/index.html:-:https://www.cdc.gov/vhf/marburg/outbreaks/chronology.html:-:https://www.cdc.gov/vhf/marburg/outbreaks/distribution-map.html:-:https://www.cdc.gov/vhf/marburg/symptoms/index.html:-:https://www.cdc.gov/vhf/virus-families/filoviridae.html:-:https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/news/astrazenecas-covid-19-vaccine-benefits-risks-context:-:https://www.facebook.com/johan.louw.507/videos/4636235436436607/:-:https://www.niaid.nih.gov/diseases-conditions/coronaviruses:-:https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-440461/v1:-:https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/2021-DON331:-:https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/marburg-virus-disease---guinea:-:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZSJKxPnloI:-:https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/26/12/20-2108_article	Marburg virus disease unrelated to Covid-19, Covid-19 vaccines or any new ‘pandemic’	['marburg virus', 'coronavirus', 'vaccine']						{'covid'}	54760	false	, , covid_pred, , , , , , , , health_pred, , , , , , , , , ,

Star newspaper headline fake	2021-04-30	africacheck	Dancan Bwire	An image of what looks like a front page of the Star , a Kenyan daily, with the headline Mass exodus from Ruto was posted on Facebook in March 2021. Underneath the headline is a brief summary : Hints of betrayal as Mt. Kenya Tanga Tanga MPS in Kirinyaga, Nakuru and Nyandarua pledge loyalty to Uhuru. William Ruto is Kenya’s deputy president and has declared interest in running for president in the 2022 elections. Uhuru Kenyatta is Kenya’s president . The two have worked together since the 2013 general election but the media have reported they have fallen out. But is the front page shared on Facebook genuine and published by the Star? We checked. Image old, photoshopped The newspaper is dated 5-7 June 2020. Africa Check searched for the sub-heading to another article on the front page, Controversy rocks Uhuru’s radical executive order, on Google. We found both the version of the front page shared on Facebook and what appears to be the original front page in the search results. The original front page has a different headline : Scramble for Luhya vote bloc begins. We searched for this headline on Twitter and found another copy of the real front page, published by the Star on 4 June 2020. The version circulating on social media has been digitally manipulated. The main photo on the genuine front page is also different. The Star did not publish an article with the front-page headline Mass exodus from Ruto.	https://drive.google.com/file/d/185tguMeB5FgBFnk_DPlFqxQ0nYXrTEyr/view?usp=sharing:-:https://drive.google.com/file/d/1B_MlwJMAHV9vxTfLOk6zbQ7qyQX0Agn7/view?usp=sharing:-:https://nairobinews.nation.co.ke/featured/uhuru-ruto-fallout-what-caused-it:-:https://test.deputypresident.go.ke/:-:https://twitter.com/TheStarKenya/status/1268621976198840320:-:https://www.facebook.com/mc.jcobs.5/posts/774195320186149:-:https://www.facebook.com/photo?fbid=115588110601352&set=bc.Abqt1VgMW6pnfEN8LckQPVeAkvy5PdU8ANY0WMHiBn-BQYtEJ_Gu5DIYiIj1JnT61zpMhDMOAH6Vw7T3V9p9P0Ulm_c_gTeN7-r1ir82AgvR9nApzs_j7VLghnifrEaB8KnmHaVWwwbSVNDCPAhR7ivDaDogMxu8lfdySwytHGfWPg&opaqueCursor=AbrzYctilk2JBmUllOTE8fJ3Mcz0JQ8HMrKipHd2mSGQN9jh5Lii07_Ze9FEDqq8Bhs-l0kv_e5193fz0CVQzbzfdCptAIZ4k8ko51HPP4JIAI1l3YMXz4uQoYvO2i8w4ESE9h6_6YbhJL55lkz8kPjMPlJkX_wrI0ToxVzyyvo80rHZmosgie4Q4HJXAYU0YZCYkJ_PC5VZG3fOeXUsFagbQW5MqpwA10Vi-g3t6B8R7NvOEvolnbhzeVxizhjKydOCcgsLwqAyvw-PHsdGm4o6OG6ODHpalwily-8gYyJh_BbxlpmkTM26bEnc7at649ktsmcoKyp8iuWkXIDJ5iBWOvBU84up5a7cMkbxxDjpTkSS0kOjzV_WxYnXc-ZXg4LrK4-JrOzelbMB4dIITwaUv3HGTllL_TJakLwjdvxML7s17qgakzsHMDJpOyIjCcXc-hKwA6tpmDUrsV-PzkwUpRP09ZzGbevxCQZb_uQATICq2YJE4OqR3bG1jm60NDPSKg2pLwKR5W7LbSIWdO3b:-:https://www.facebook.com/photo?fbid=1653508198152900&set=basw.AbqfzpizEfDZbN1FHlcqHvwcyqbHaqZ_4CvdkkpcrLR0VJX3s25k0r5vF2dxcC0xU1oFeBfGyK2X9ZRC7Wf_rSJeW_Bry3He1BRalGKyUzozCRbELTJbGKYL0k1lANjAlYX7Q8DaQLjlpChbb35ioa1MxweYQ_vPwzeTXQ8f9P0_4g&opaqueCursor=Abo0zccGhP7MqtINQ0xIjLJ11yBA922bfhhrP69ynj8uuMRVJI8gLZPnlB_OVPfqdwiVSy1YsNqQpo1Iz8aylggP_6oEcowJJ2F3-4dMI8S3PvgQsiAYE6R-9gHiG1BVmnqg5FI4KRYJSB6P7o7hmb-OTttItKQK3p_ziE_TQs3zDrPQFjf508oyFrkugxRiLWeR3_yFnyqkv5Rp99J4OqXTwk7Z5hv6hOdH-SDa0FnZRSewrqitxO7s3MOk--KEFyNdvMEcMd7eeb-cKZpNpMj-nGeG1xMsW21kL9Ux1Wq_oNop3DVYZqgxR4TFkWB7xy4vvMwNYSW10iDbD66PFovKU1_imeKtAA-bCvB4ET7eVlOvVXOoWAK8O_a-KhC_4OET2VvWZFUDPTi6u1XCdrgO1KDGZZQB5FSoOsi-73pq7xm-O6xs2vJef1DpOD4_pXzjeak47Brk6OmgTsuR7TW-9mfG2dituMRD9HLhY5V-BMgJM1QwLgd8-vYDQj1_LDzEsV3xq54JGnvcbcf5Z1su8_ZrgMRvvUYhuPbngzDSI1MQrrFpeq1NEAnT6VVK1g8:-:https://www.facebook.com/photo?fbid=774194550186226&set=bc.AbrWTM8NpvMWjfz7BbNMlZr-PdgQbPe8DZgptQ8xFz0TkgKtQk8JHjNzGzemOdwSUjQFUfUpPUPOU27IMY3xe24XQHT-HAC5OEJbl7ypWAFW1Y6cytRNlOcsccN1skE5391DuWvU_hVbgs6Sjzy61Uv6e_9bVfAklZtnd0wZxjXSwA&opaqueCursor=AbrvZgYgIvV3JcCMbwTACgHbXhhWHevXbljLs98A6sEcZypr01NyH09YAEUzI2nPpv89oakc3OorsctycBlC5zjSCzGz2cSEm5SxbcJyr5z_d9yG-mQv18NuT4jldKyUupFKJI_JFpx7Mm3AB1F2QOZh1mDfFVzkcZt244uNeQ47l0klUenrwBtWH8jlyqKhUE1Z_MQiGeIsLNb3e9MW7jGVls9lNL-93zeglu_cLameO3DLHPN3ziStERPg1PhTMrHM1LGoOLaz3FEJ99zKOjujHJxqb-FDxWGG3Et2Luh9r0mgmjInmjzSGIF4HmuHCqlPxxP4QO4NrCkxmnxw6GzJ9KEAj6KbET4A8bCRLdWjSurLyYXeC_K4qpv9TD_g0UG_GRClsXj-zzgWpb_7hiVsaOQKiTKJZe63xdfxQuqHaK1r5hUJM6-5qrkew_YzHh4x_bL02zuTx_LlU-WTIvu1S7v_8y0UbD1hPsDRAKve9V3J2yaH3ens8uW6FU8ZGY6mXEbXGzBd24D8kyltJDOJ:-:https://www.president.go.ke/presidency/:-:https://www.the-star.co.ke/	‘Mass exodus from Ruto’?

It’s a scam	2020-09-11	africacheck	Africa Check	The Facebook page Uganda Redcross offers jobs at the Uganda Red Cross Society , claiming the humanitarian organisation is conducting mass recruitment . But it’s a scam. Like many Facebook-based scams Africa Check has exposed before, it links to a Google Form where job seekers can supposedly apply. Various positions are advertised, for doctors, drivers, accountants, receptionists and more. In the comments, many job seekers have expressed interest . ‘Public vigilance and caution’ The page was created on 27 March 2019 and has 722 followers. The Uganda Red Cross Society’s verified Facebook page was created on 20 October 2010. It has more than 30,000 followers. And the society has issued a press statement warning of viral job scams circulating on social media. It has come to our attention that there are fraudulent job postings on several social media platforms for a mass recruitment process at the Uganda Red Cross Society, the statement reads. There is no party contracted to act for and on behalf of Uganda Red Cross to recruit staff, volunteers or members. For open vacancies, Uganda Red Cross uses the official website redcrossug.org/join-us/jobs . This therefore comes to call for public vigilance and caution. Our guide to Facebook scams and how to spot them explains how you can avoid being duped by fraudulent pages like this. – Dancan Bwire	https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScEp9rNjKgbjRvv-rJ-HEhPTu7RcEpv4GKtG6pwIBucEAdJqg/closedform:-:https://drive.google.com/file/d/1x_5IAPfFRRd0wvFo5nL3qfBkzn2CDv2T/view?usp=sharing:-:https://www.facebook.com/Uganda-Red-Cross-Society-117683891624272/:-:https://www.facebook.com/Uganda-Redcross-821691088190306:-:https://www.facebook.com/help/196050490547892:-:https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=821700158189399&id=821691088190306&__cft__%5b0%5d=AZW0e28iTjZi8XcoTjSy2pEwTqrQIWzL7Q5peY4m8W85v_d_7Pws1qX55_ojWTOtaEtVbvH0uo1ohyFk8hXL2W9SVyFB83lMKnRNT4QbI37w8jEtfmnpc5SN3d8MWf4-DYNUYQaAY_y15h1OH_PAtLUPuQN7efUFfV5dzZjpwumGyw&__tn__=%2CO%2CP-R:-:https://www.redcrossug.org/:-:https://www.redcrossug.org/join-us/jobs:-:https://www.redcrossug.org/publications/press-release/download/7-press-release/37-press-release?fbclid=IwAR34mCmyumUBCVdXRsCEtoz6LymmzTcmoZylfq4_s23CobVR3xdaooO8K2I	Mass recruitment at Uganda Red Cross?

No, photo from Vietnam	2020-10-22	africacheck	Africa Check	A photo of a huge crowd massed on each side of a road as a long convoy of vehicles drives by has been posted on Facebook with the claim it shows Kenyan deputy president William Ruto’s grand entrance into Meru county. Hustler nation spreads faster than fire on Tsavo forest, reads the caption of the photo, posted on 17 October 2020. This Meru county Maua area. Over 900,000 ground chronic supporters of powerful force in Africa Dr. William Ruto along the road. Ruto, who uses the slogan hustler nation in his campaign for the 2022 presidential election, was in Meru county on 17 October, where he addressed locals. But does the photo show the deputy president driving into the county? Funeral procession in Vietnam A reverse image search brings up clearer versions that show the people in the photo are mostly not black . One of the images leads to a YouTube video uploaded on 3 October 2014. The photo is a still from the video, which is titled , in Vietnamese: Vĩnh Biệt Đại Tướng Võ Nguyên Giáp.4-10-2013. This translates as: Farewell to General Vo Nguyen Giap. 4-10-2013. The video is described as showing the funeral procession of General Vo Nguyen Giap as recorded at Xuan Thuy Street in Hanoi, Vietnam’s capital . General Vo Nguyen died on 4 October 2013, aged 102 years. He was buried on 13 October 2013. Other photos of the event also appeared in Vietnamese media. It’s clear the photo shared on Facebook doesn’t show Ruto in Meru on 17 October 2020. – Dancan Bwire	https://drive.google.com/file/d/15E6ruyDXXzNyiFqTlKD_uzqCLVU-jCey/view?usp=sharing:-:https://drive.google.com/file/d/1CJUdYYzEneq7b5_MdvO0YSwKkfuHBpr9/view?usp=sharing:-:https://twitter.com/WilliamsRuto/status/1317440502975860736:-:https://vietnamnews.vn/politics-laws/246201/nation-bids-final-farewell.html:-:https://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-asia-24510479:-:https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-24402278:-:https://www.britannica.com/place/Hanoi:-:https://www.facebook.com/araplomutono.paul/posts/831784347561908:-:https://www.facebook.com/araplomutono.paul/posts/831784347561908?__tn__=%2CO*F:-:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb4hG2b7MqM	Massive crowd of Kenyan deputy president Ruto’s ‘chronic supporters’ in Meru?

Melinda Gates , co-chair of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and wife of US billionaire Bill Gates , has said the coronavirus pandemic will make Africa have dead bodies lying on the streets. That’s the claim in a 12 April 2020 post on Facebook in Kenya . Melinda Gates, renowned billionaire Gates wife says the lack of testing kits in Africa is the reason why the continent’s Novel Coronavirus cases are low, and this will make Africa have dead bodies lying on the streets, the post says . Covid-19 will be horrible in the developing world, she said. My heart is in Africa. I am worried. The only reason why the reported cases of the coronavirus disease in Africa is low now is most likely because there have not been wide testing of people. The disease is going to bite hard on the continent. I see dead bodies in the streets of Africa, Melinda said. Variations on the claim have been posted elsewhere on Facebook . All have been flagged as possibly false by the social network’s fact-checking system . Did Gates say this? ‘Look at Ecuador’ A Google search for the words Melinda Gates bodies on streets of Africa led Africa Check to an interview with Gates by CNN’s Poppy Harlow , posted on YouTube on 10 April 2020. Here Gates expressed her fear that vulnerable populations in developing countries could be overwhelmed by the Covid-19 pandemic . It’s going to be horrible in the developing world. And part of the reason you’re seeing that case numbers don’t look very bad is because they don’t have access to very many tests, she said . So, look at Ecuador. Look at what’s going on in Ecuador. They’re putting bodies out on the street. You’re going to see that in countries in Africa. Early April saw several media reports of coronavirus victims’ bodies being left on the street in Guayaquil , Ecuador’s most populous city. The city is said to be the emerging epicentre of Latin America’s Covid-19 outbreak. Coronavirus led to ‘first thoughts’ about Africa The Gates Foundation works in health, infectious diseases, water and sanitation programmes in African countries. In the interview, Gates said that after seeing the extent of China’s lockdown – and the logistics required – her first thoughts were about how Africa would handle the pandemic. How in the world are they going to deal with these? Washing your hands and keeping a social distance from other people are two of the best ways to avoid coronavirus infection. They are encouraged by the World Health Organization , the US Centers for Disease Control and African governments . But Gates pointed out that these basic measures are nearly impossible for people living in slum conditions. If you live in a slum, you can’t physical distance, you have to go out and get your meal, you don’t have clean water to wash your hands, she said . Gates did say that a lack of resources meant that African countries could, like Ecuador, see people putting the bodies of coronavirus victims out on the street. Some websites have suggested Gates said the streets of African countries will be littered with dead bodies or have piles of dead bodies , or that she even wants dead bodies on the streets of Africa . This is inaccurate. – Dancan Bwire	http://www.health.go.ke/#1585087883679-53e51c03-198373d1-981a:-:http://www.thezimbabwenewslive.com/melinda-gates-predicts-piles-of-dead-bodies-on-african-streets-due-to-coronavirus/:-:https://amref.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/2019-Coronavirus-Disease-COVID-19-Safety-Information.pdf:-:https://edition.cnn.com/2020/04/03/americas/guayaquil-ecuador-overwhelmed-coronavirus-intl/index.html:-:https://edition.cnn.com/CNN/anchors_reporters/harlow.poppy.html:-:https://theessencetv.com/2020/04/13/covid-19-africa-will-soon-have-dead-bodies-lying-on-the-streets-bill-gates-wife-melinda-video/?fbclid=IwAR2oMM1FxQ0rus31TiY9JEctPzr3DaoZczHlPgneRGMVo_wM4DH1C_OREDo:-:https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/prevention.html:-:https://www.facebook.com/110387443943706/photos/a.113006877015096/122685899380527/?type=3&theater:-:https://www.facebook.com/groups/kenyapolitforum/permalink/2528891334076306/:-:https://www.facebook.com/joeigbokwe.igbokwe/posts/2811023442279473:-:https://www.facebook.com/journalismproject/programs/third-party-fact-checking:-:https://www.facebook.com/the211magazine/posts/2290184874618903:-:https://www.gatesfoundation.org/:-:https://www.gatesfoundation.org/Where-We-Work/Africa-Office:-:https://www.gatesfoundation.org/Who-We-Are/General-Information/Leadership/Executive-Leadership-Team/Bill-Gates:-:https://www.gatesfoundation.org/who-we-are/general-information/leadership/executive-leadership-team/melinda-gates:-:https://www.google.com/maps/place/Guayaquil,+Ecuador/:-:https://www.kenyatalk.com/index.php?threads/melinda-gates-wants-dead-bodies-on-the-streets-of-africa.145788/:-:https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2020-04-01/coronavirus-in-guayaquil-ecuador-bodies-in-the-streets:-:https://www.msn.com/en-ca/news/world/uncollected-bodies-lie-for-days-in-the-streets-of-guayaquil-ecuador-the-emerging-epicenter-of-the-coronavirus-in-latin-america/ar-BB128iKk:-:https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/the_americas/coronavirus-guayaquil-ecuador-bodies-corpses-streets/2020/04/03/79c786c8-7522-11ea-ad9b-254ec99993bc_story.html:-:https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019:-:https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/advice-for-public:-:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHsfjnRB-uA:-:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSVse07y2O4:-:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSVse07y2O4&feature=youtu.be&t=192:-:https://yen.com.gh/153421-covid-19-you-dead-bodies-streets-africa-melinda-gates-warns.html:-:https://youtu.be/qSVse07y2O4?t=192	Melinda Gates said she feared coronavirus in Africa would lead to dead being put out in street, as in Ecuador	['africa', 'coronavirus', 'correct', 'covid-19', 'kenya']						{'covid'}	54768	true	, , covid_pred, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,

That’s the claim in a message posted by a Facebook user in Nigeria on the group page Herbs remedies International . The page is described as a group of people that come together to help each other with remedies on all ailments. The remedy’s ingredients are given as bitter melon (bara in Yoruba) and fermented water of pap (omi ogi). This remedy is very powerful which can make u visit rest room very well, the user writes. But is there evidence that the mixture works? Not a scientifically proven remedy A few local studies have investigated the use of tropical plants in the treatment of reproductive conditions. But Africa Check found no evidence in scientific literature for this particular mixture’s use as a treatment. Michael Aziken , a fertility expert and professor of obstetrics and gynaecology at the College of Medicine in Nigeria’s University of Benin , rated the claim false. There is no scientific evidence to the claim, he said. There are many other options to treat blocked fallopian tubes which do not involve surgery. I am saying this because there are women who may be scared of undergoing surgery. My advice is to visit a general practitioner who would then refer them to a gynaecologist. Cosmos Enyindah , a professor of obstetrics and gynaecology at the faculty of clinical sciences at Nigeria’s University of Port Harcourt , said the effectiveness of the mixture would be unproven until there was replicable scientific evidence to back it. I am hearing this claim for the first time. Whoever came up with the mixture must subject it to some form of clinical trials. It must be tested on a group of women with the various health issues listed in the claim before it can be proven to work. He advised women with any of these reproductive conditions to visit a gynaecologist instead of drinking the mixture. – Motunrayo Joel	https://web.facebook.com/groups/3394115920604807/about/:-:https://web.facebook.com/groups/3394115920604807/permalink/3719437081406021/?__tn__=-R:-:https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Cosmos_Enyindah:-:https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Michael_Aziken:-:https://www.uniben.edu/:-:https://www.uniport.edu.ng/	Melon and maize mixture no remedy for irregular periods and other reproductive conditions	['incorrect', 'melon and maize mixture']							54769	false	, , , , , , , , , , health_pred, , , , , , , , , , 
54770				incorrect				africacheck	https://africacheck.org/about/authors/africa-check	https://africacheck.org/fact-checks/meta-programme-fact-checks/meme-two-young-womens-scientific-discoveries-gets-facts	Meme on two young women’s scientific discoveries gets the facts wrong	2019-12-02	africacheck	Africa Check	The seemingly amazing scientific achievements of two young women – Aisha Mustafa (19) and Angela Zhang (17) – are described in a meme shared on Facebook in Nigeria and South Africa. At age 19, Aisha Mustafa, an Egyptian young physicist, devised a new type of propulsion system based on quantum theory that could propel space probes and artificial satellites without using any fuel, it reads . At age 17, Angela Zhang, a Chinese schoolgirl, created an advanced nanoparticle, one that kills cancer. But the meme was flagged as possibly false by Facebook’s fact-checking system , prompting Africa Check to investigate. Did the two teens really make these scientific breakthroughs? ‘So-called discovery false’ In 2012, a number of news outlets reported that 19-year-old Aisha Mustafa, a physics student at Egypt’s Sohag University, had patented a propulsion system that could drive spacecraft without a drop of fuel. The system was said to use quantum physics instead of thrusters. One of the articles quotes Mustafa as saying that neither the astronomy department nor the physics department at her university were able to practically test or implement her discovery. Africa Check asked physicist Dr Izak Snyman if such an invention was possible. He’s based at the School of Physics at the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg, South Africa. I am very certain that the claims regarding the so-called discovery are false, Snyman said. He told us that, to his knowledge, no person by the name of Aisha Mustafa had made any claims to a new propulsion invention based on quantum theory on any scientifically recognised platform. Some of the 2012 news articles say the energy source for Mustafa’s invention is the quantum vacuum. The vacuum indeed has interesting quantum mechanical properties, but you can’t tap energy out of it, Snyman said. It costs energy to accelerate a spacecraft, and energy cannot be created out of nothing. Design of potential treatment for cancer Angela Zhang is the daughter of Chinese immigrants to the US. She’s currently a graduate student at the Stanford School of Medicine ’s Joseph Wu Lab in California . While Zhang was still in high school, she designed a cancer treatment research project titled Design of Image-guided, Photo-thermal Controlled Drug Releasing Multifunctional Nanosystem for the Treatment of Cancer Stem Cells . The project was described as a novel treatment for cancer that could someday lead to a cure. It wasn’t an actual cure. Her design used nanoparticles – very small particles – to target cancer tumours, treat cancerous cells with medicine and monitor treatment responses. By 2012, Zhang had only tested the treatment on mice . It will take years to find out if it works on people. I created a nanoparticle that's kind of like the Swiss Army knife of cancer treatment in that it can detect cancer cells, eradicate the cancer cells and then monitor the treatment response, Zhang was quoted as saying in an article on ZDNet . In 2011, she won the US$100,000 individual prize at the Siemens Competition in Math, Science & Technology for her project. An expert said claims of Mustafa’s discovery were false, and hadn’t been reported on any scientific platform. Zhang did design a system with the potential to treat cancer, but it hasn’t been proven to kill cancer. The meme is incorrect. – Eileen Jahn	http://inr.synapticdigital.com/Siemens/Competition2011/:-:http://med.stanford.edu/:-:http://med.stanford.edu/ccne/ccne-t/news.html:-:http://med.stanford.edu/news/all-news/2012/01/three-former-high-school-interns-win-national-science-prizes.html:-:http://med.stanford.edu/wulab.html:-:http://med.stanford.edu/wulab/people.html:-:http://www.digitaljournal.com/article/325785:-:https://inhabitat.com/an-egyptian-teenager-has-created-a-next-generation-quantum-space-propulsion-system/:-:https://new.siemens.com/us/en/company/about/usa-foundations.html:-:https://www.al-fanarmedia.org/2013/08/technology-companies-seek-out-arab-students/:-:https://www.britannica.com/science/nanoparticle:-:https://www.businessinsider.com/this-teenager-might-cure-cancer-2012-7?IR=T:-:https://www.facebook.com/help/publisher/182222309230722:-:https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10218118418729676&set=a.1203945776496&type=3&theater:-:https://www.fastcompany.com/1837966/mustafas-space-drive-egyptian-students-quantum-physics-invention:-:https://www.gizmodo.com.au/2012/05/awesome-teenager-invents-a-new-form-of-quantum-space-travel/:-:https://www.linkedin.com/in/angela-zhang-b2755b105:-:https://www.usnews.com/news/the-next-generation-of-stem/articles/2015/05/12/cancer-fighting-harvard-student-looks-forward-to-a-long-future-in-stem:-:https://www.wits.ac.za/:-:https://www.wits.ac.za/physics/:-:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ5WYN22YG0:-:https://www.zdnet.com/article/17-year-old-devises-potential-cure-for-cancer/	Meme on two young women’s scientific discoveries gets the facts wrong	['incorrect', 'nigeria', 'south africa']							54770	false	, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , science_pred, , , ,

But that’s only half the shocking story – the arrest was made in northeastern Nigeria, not Kenya. A photo showing two men holding what seem to be human skulls, sitting next to a suitcase full of bones, is circulating in Kenya. It has been posted with the claim that they were arrested in the country. Two arrested with human bones. They said they use them to make bracelets in Kiambu county, one caption reads. Kiambu county is just north of the Kenyan capital Nairobi. The photo started being shared soon after a politician from Kiambu was arrested on 14 October 2022 on suspicion of murdering her husband. Many users sharing the photo mention the county, suggesting the two events can be compared or imply something about Kiambu. A different user claimed it showed men from the Kisii community in Kenya. The photo has been posted here , here , here , here , here , here , here and here . But does the photo show two men arrested in Kenya with human bones? We checked. Photo from Nigeria A reverse image search of the photo reveals it was first published by local media outlets in Nigeria. They report that the photo shows two men who were arrested by police in Adamawa state in northeastern Nigeria on 11 October. According to one article , the two were in possession and trading in human skulls and several human bones in Garware village, Fufore Local Government Area of the state. The article added that the men were Cameroonian and that two others were also arrested in connection to the alleged crime.

Men convicted of rape will be castrated in Nigeria under new law, the tweet reads . Included is a link to a news article with the same headline. The Instagram post was flagged as possibly false by Facebook’s fact-checking system . Although the claim is true, one important detail has been left out of the headline. Punishment signed into law in one Nigerian state The headline of the New York Post article claims that men convicted of rape will be castrated in Nigeria under a new law. But the punishment is being implemented in one Nigerian state, not the entire country. This clarification is only made in the body of the article. According to the legislation , signed by Kaduna state governor Nasir el-Rufai on 11 September 2020, men convicted of raping children under the age of 14 will have their testicles surgically removed, and then be executed. Men convicted of raping people over the age of 14 also face castration, followed by life imprisonment. The drastic measures are intended to protect children from serious crime, a government spokesperson is quoted as saying . According to the United Nations Children's Fund , one in four girls in Nigeria is sexually abused before they turn 18. A number of credible news outlets have reported on these severe penalties and their reception by society. – Africa Check	https://nypost.com/:-:https://nypost.com/2020/09/17/men-convicted-of-rape-to-be-castrated-in-nigeria-in-new-law/?utm_medium=SocialFlow&utm_source=NYPTwitter&utm_campaign=SocialFlow:-:https://twitter.com/GovKaduna/status/1306309119893221380?s=20:-:https://twitter.com/nypost/status/1306692839401807875?s=20:-:https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-54117462:-:https://www.facebook.com/journalismproject/programs/third-party-fact-checking:-:https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/africa/rapists-surgical-castration-nigeria-kaduna-state-b484070.html:-:https://www.instagram.com/p/CFZvJ5HnBxz/?utm_source=ig_embed:-:https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/17/world/africa/nigeria-rape-castration.html:-:https://www.telegraph.co.uk/global-health/climate-and-people/child-rapists-nigerian-state-castrated-harsh-new-law/:-:https://www.unicef.org/:-:https://www.unicef.org/nigeria/child-protection	Men convicted of rape will be castrated in one Nigerian state under new law	['correct', 'nigeria', 'rape']							54772	true	, , , crime_pred, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,

At least, that’s the claim in a message posted on Facebook in Nigeria on 11 October 2020. The post shows a photo of a man wearing only his underpants, standing at a podium. A pile of what seems to be his suit, tie and shoes lies at his feet as he appears to address people off camera. You are ashamed to see me naked but you are not ashamed to see your people moving on the streets naked, barefooted and hungry after you have stolen all their money and wealth, the message quotes the man as saying. It identifies him only as a member of parliament in Mexico, but gives no other details or context. The post has been viewed more than 7.4 million times in just a few days. Did a Mexican MP strip to his underwear to shame other politicians for stealing from the country’s poor? We checked. Protest against energy bill in 2013 A Google reverse image search reveals that the photo first appeared online in 2013 and shows an incident that took place in Mexico’s congress . The man is Antonio Garcia Conejo , a representative of the Democratic Revolution Party . Conejo made headlines on 13 December 2013 when he stripped naked to protest the congress’s approval of a controversial energy bill that would allow private companies to drill for oil and gas. This bill signalled the first time Mexico would allow private firms to drill for oil and gas with state-owned energy firm Pemex since the country nationalised its oil industry in 1938. Conejo was one of the politicians who spoke against the controversial bill. No record of quote in news reports But the quote does not appear to be by Conejo. The Spanish-language El Comunista reported at the time that Conejo stripped off his clothes to symbolise that in passing the law, the Mexican government would be allowing foreign-owned firms and private companies to strip the country of its natural resources. Just as they have stripped the nation by privatising Telephones of Mexico, so they are stripping the Nation, the publication quotes him as saying, in a machine translation of the Spanish. I'm not ashamed, because that's what they're doing. They took away and privatised Telefonos de México and where is the benefit? The BBC quotes Conejo as saying: This is how you're stripping the nation. Where is the benefit? I'm not ashamed, what you're doing is a shame. We googled the quote in the Facebook post – both in English and translated into Spanish – and could not find any evidence that Conejo said it during his 2013 protest. A Mexican politician did strip to his underwear in protest during parliamentary proceedings, in 2013. The protest was not against corruption, but against a new energy bill that would allow private companies to drill for oil and gas. And he did not say the words attributed to him in the Facebook post. – Naledi Mashishi	http://sil.gobernacion.gob.mx/Librerias/pp_PerfilLegislador.php?SID=&Referencia=9216791:-:https://elcomunista.net/:-:https://elcomunista.net/2013/12/13/diputado-mexicano-se-desnuda-en-protesta-por-la-reforma-energetica-video/:-:https://translate.google.com/translate?newwindow=1&gs_lcp=CgZwc3ktYWIQAzINCAAQsQMQgwEQyQMQQzIFCAAQkQIyCAgAELEDEIMBMggIABCxAxCDATIICAAQsQMQgwEyAggAMgIIADICCAAyAggAMgIIADoHCAAQRxCwAzoICAAQyQMQkQI6CwguEMcBEK8BEJECOgoIABCxAxCDARBDOgsILhCxAxDHARCjAjoICC4QsQMQgwE6DgguELEDEIMBEMcBEKMCOggILhCxAxCRAjoFCAAQsQM6BAgAEEM6AgguULqiA1i8rwNgvrIDaABwAHgAgAHOAogByhWSAQUyLTguMpgBAKABAaoBB2d3cy13aXrIAQjAAQE&uact=5&um=1&ie=UTF-8&hl=en&client=tw-ob&sl=es&tl=en&u=https%3A%2F%2Felcomunista.net%2F2013%2F12%2F13%2Fdiputado-mexicano-se-desnuda-en-protesta-por-la-reforma-energetica-video%2F:-:https://www.bakerinstitute.org/political-parties-mexico/:-:https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-25350993:-:https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=4618442428197654&set=a.177160135659261&type=3&theater:-:https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidblackmon/2013/08/13/mexicos-complex-history-with-foreign-oil-investment/#3cc82ece30f3:-:https://www.indiatoday.in/world/mad-mad-world/story/mexican-congressman-antonio-garcia-conejo-strips-to-protest-energy-privatisation-bill-220675-2013-12-13:-:https://www.larepublica.ec/blog/2013/12/12/diputado-mexicano-desnuda-debate-reforma-energetica/:-:https://www.loc.gov/law/help/national-parliaments/mexico.php	Mexican politician stripped naked to protest energy bill, and words not by him	['misleading']							54773	false	, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,

This is false; the CBC confirmed it never published such an article, and internet searches for the headline also do not find such a story. Omg these legacy news reporters are something else. Canada is the blame for farmers standing up for themselves! Give me a break, says a July 7, 2022, Facebook post . It includes an image -- without a link -- of what appears to be a CBC article with a headline: Dutch Prime Minister declares state of emergency, claims farm protests are being orchestrated by a Canadian militia group known as 'The Diagolon.' Screenshot taken on July 14, 2022 of a Facebook post The same image was shared thousands of times on Twitter from an account that has since been suspended . Diagolon is the name of a far-right group which researchers say seeks to inflame social divisions, often through violence. Local media reported the group took part in a border blockade in the Western province of Alberta at the same time as protesting truckers occupied the Canadian capital Ottawa in early 2022. The image circulated online as thousands demonstrated against the Dutch government's far-reaching plan to cut nitrogen emissions, with farmers particularly outraged by moves to decrease emissions by livestock. But the screenshot does not show an authentic CBC article, the national broadcaster confirmed. Contacted by AFP, CBC spokesman Chuck Thompson said: We can confirm this is not a real CBC News article. A search for the headline on CBC.ca did not produce any results. A similar search on Google did not find the purported article either. AFP Fact Check previously examined other imposter content , or images made to look like genuine stories from Canadian media outlets.	https://archive.ph/O89CH:-:https://perma.cc/8F5H-3HX7?view-mode=server-side&type=image:-:https://perma.cc/M9GF-6YNE:-:https://perma.cc/RVB7-GWP8?view-mode=server-side&type=image:-:https://web.archive.org/web/20220714190623/https://twitter.com/SweetingElaine:-:https://www.ctvnews.ca/canada/what-is-the-diagolon-extremist-group-and-what-does-it-want-1.5785646:-:https://www.dw.com/en/fact-check-fake-news-and-content-targets-international-media/a-62381229:-:https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20220130-hundreds-of-truckers-block-ottawa-in-freedom-convoy-to-protest-vaccine-mandates:-:https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20220622-dutch-farmers-protest-livestock-cuts-to-curb-nitrogen	Image does not show CBC story on Dutch farmer's protests								59534	false	, , , , , , , environment & climate_pred, , , , , , , , , , , , ,

While a bomb went off near a shopping mall in Yangon that day, a representative for the Shwedagon pagoda told AFP there was no explosion at the Buddhist site. The photos in the posts that show explosions were taken in Lebanon and Somalia -- not Myanmar -- while the video shows an unrelated incident. Many died after a bomb blast at the Shwedagon pagoda on full moon day, reads the Burmese-laguage title to this blog that shared the images and video on July 14, 2022. The images form a collage with superimposed Burmese-language text that translates as: Many died on full moon day / Bomb blast at the Shwedagon pagoda / 68 civilians died and 8 vehicles burned down to ashes. A bomb blast near a Yangon shopping mall on the afternoon of July 12 killed two people and wounded eleven, rescue workers and local media said. The explosion took place as the country celebrated the full moon day of warso that marks the first sermon given by the Buddha. Screenshot of the misleading post, taken July 15, 2022 The images and video were also published alongside a similar claim in blogs here , here and here . Links to some of the blogs were also shared on Facebook here , here and here . However, a member of the Shwedagon pagoda's board of trustees told AFP that there was no explosion at the Buddhist pagoda on July 12. People came to the pagoda until 8:00pm. Over 257,000 visitors came to the pagoda on full moon day, the board member said. Combined reverse image and keyword searches on Google found the images and video in the blogs have been shared in a false context. Shwedagon pagoda photo The first image shows the Shwedagon pagoda and was published here on a news outlet called Myanmar Digital News run by the Myanmar Ministry of Information on Mar 9, 2020. Its caption states the image was taken during the full moon day of Tabaung , the final month of Burmese lunar calendar. Below is a screenshot comparison of the image in the misleading posts (left) and the photo published by Myanmar Digital News (right): A screenshot comparison between the misleading blog post’s photo (left) and Myanmar Digital News’s photo (right) Unrelated bombing photos The second image is an AFP photo of an explosion in Lebanon's capital Beirut in 2013. The photo was captioned: Civilians gather at the [site] of an explosion in Beirut's southern suburb neighbourhood of Bir al-Abed on July 9, 2013. A car bomb rocked Beirut's southern suburbs, stronghold of Lebanon's Shiite Hezbollah movement, wounding 15 people, television reports and a military source said. Below is a screenshot comparison of the image in the misleading post (left) and the AFP photo (right): Screenshot comparison of the image in the misleading post (left) and the AFP photo (right) The third image shows another AFP photo -- published on October 16, 2017 -- that shows the aftermath of a blast in Somalia’s capital Mogadishu. Its caption reads in part: Somali ambulances carrying severely injured patients from the latest explosion in Mogadishu await to access the airport where the wounded will be evacuated on Turkish military planes on October 16, 2017. Below is a screenshot comparison of the image in the misleading blog (left) and the AFP photo (right): Screenshot comparison of the image in the misleading blog (left) and the AFP photo (right) Myanmar coup photo The fourth image was previously published here by local media DVB on February 15, 2021 after the Myanmar military took over the country in a coup which detained civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi. The photo caption reads: A lot of soldiers and police stand guard in front of the Myanmar Central Bank and its Yangon branch. Below is a screenshot comparison of the image in the misleading blog (left) and the DVB News photo (right): Screenshot comparison of the image in the misleading blog (left) and the DVB News photo (right) Unrelated video The video shared in the posts contains the same photo collage as its thumbnail. However, nowhere in the clip was an actual explosion shown. Instead, it features a narrator talking about a robbery that killed a university student who carried a lot of cash after withdrawing money from a bank on July 11, 2022. The incident corresponds to this local news report .	http://burmese.dvb.no/archives/443682:-:https://archive.ph/1JuBI:-:https://nationaltoday.com/full-moon-day-of-waso/#:~:text=Full%20Moon%20Day%20of%20Waso%20is%20observed%20during%20the%20full,be%20observed%20on%20July%2012.:-:https://perma.cc/7LEV-L2HR:-:https://perma.cc/G477-4NPH:-:https://perma.cc/U5L5-TUL7:-:https://web.archive.org/web/20220715103427/https://mizzimaburmese.com/article/111177:-:https://www.afpforum.com/AFPForum/Search/ViewMedia.aspx?mui=3&hid=8FC1064ADDAD08E96FA9DF22D885152DC09CC9C34B7EC1F6CDEE340BA81A1B43&cck=a1aff2:-:https://www.afpforum.com/AFPForum/Search/ViewMedia.aspx?pn=1&smd=8&mui=3&q=3935652610760677840_0&fst=car+bomb+July+9+Beirut&fto=3&t=2&hid=A87BFB8A05F82892243DDF128DE738A6FB162FEDDBE9E88E3BE3680FC6D637AA8C038BC15CBDDAD2&iir=1&opi=1&Psv=0&from=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYWZwZm9ydW0uY29tL0FGUEZvcnVtL1NlYXJjaC9SZXN1bHRzLmFzcHg%2fcG49MSZzbWQ9OCZtdWk9MyZxPTM5MzU2NTI2MTA3NjA2Nzc4NDBfMCZmc3Q9Y2FyK2JvbWIrSnVseSs5K0JlaXJ1dCZmdG89MyZ0PTI%3d&mpn=1:-:https://www.barrons.com/news/bomb-in-myanmar-s-yangon-kills-two-wounds-nine-01657710607:-:https://www.evernote.com/shard/s415/sh/15ad23fd-afc5-482c-9495-8c777e7e862d/5c2c0cdf9f2bb267d727ac7b3db3595b:-:https://www.evernote.com/shard/s415/sh/9874812a-2487-41ec-ba11-b09577a0ee4f/c0aa50b1c8395853fe0933146bf6d507:-:https://www.evernote.com/shard/s415/sh/bba5eef3-a193-4680-b083-49428fafb8e7/ca29d85ed517b18cb8fe275c7feeb29b:-:https://www.mdn.gov.mm/en/shwedagon-pagoda-marks-2608th-anniversary-full-moon-day-tabaung:-:https://www.myanmore.com/2019/03/what-to-expect-on-full-moon-day-of-tabaung/	False posts about 'bomb blast at Myanmar Buddhist site' misuse old images								59535	false	, , covid_pred, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,

However, the claim is false. The photo was taken in Amsterdam outside the Johan Cruyff Arena , before a performance by US singer Billie Eilish on June 18 at the adjacent Ziggo Dome. After the Dutch march against climate change and pollution in central Rotterdam, the Netherlands, reads the photo's simplified-Chinese caption, shared here on Twitter on June 21. The photo, which appears to show discarded cans, bottles and plastic bags , has been shared more than 160 times. It circulated after thousands of people attended a large climate march in Rotterdam, which was covered by local media here , here and here . The march, which was organised by the Dutch Climate Coalition, took place on June 19 between 1 pm and 5 pm. Screenshot of the misleading tweet, taken on July 15, 2022. The photo was shared alongside a similar claim in Chinese on Twitter and Weibo as well as in Dutch on Facebook . However, the claim is false: the photo was taken in a different city in the Netherlands in a context unrelated to the climate march. Rubbish outside stadium in Amsterdam A reverse image search on Google led to similar photos on Twitter here and here , which were posted on June 18 -- a day before the climate march. AFP reached out to one Twitter user who published a photo that shows similar pieces of litter to those seen in the misleading posts. Below is a screenshot comparison of the photo used in the misleading post (left) and the photo published on Twitter on June 18 (right), with corresponding pieces of litter circled by AFP: The user @RensKatyCatP told AFP the photo was taken in Amsterdam on June 18 before a concert by American singer Billie Eilish. They also sent AFP a screenshot of the photo's metadata, which verified the date and time it was captured: Screenshot of the metadata attached to the photo provided by @RensKatyCatP, captured on June 23, 2022. Eilish performed at the Ziggo Dome , which is next to the Johan Cruyff Arena, on June 18. According to the venue's website , she was scheduled to perform at 9:15 pm, about two hours after the photo showing the littered street was posted on Twitter. Details in the photo shared in misleading social media posts also correspond to features around the Johan Cruyff Arena that are visible in Google Street View. Below is a screenshot comparison of matching features highlighted by AFP, including signposts (yellow), steps (red) and a restaurant sign (blue). Rotterdam climate march AFP has previously debunked claims that used photos of litter to discredit climate activists, including here in Canada and here in Australia. Bram Karst, a spokesperson for the Rotterdam climate march, denied that the photo shared online showed the aftermath of the demonstration. This was not the case at all. Those people are there to support the climate, and if something drops by accident, like a protest sign, then it is cleaned up properly, Karst told AFP on June 21. Karst also tweeted this photo on June 20 with a caption that says it shows cleaners at the end of the march on June 19.

The screenshot includes a ranking chart credited to the American newspaper and Transparency International, a corruption watchdog. However, the claim is false; the Wall Street Journal's report was actually published in 2012. The survey featured in the report has been discontinued, the international corruption watchdog told AFP. The screenshot of an article from a Malaysian website called The Coverage was published on Facebook here on June 26, 2022, where it has been reshared more than 1,200 times. The article's headline reads: Wall Street Journal: Malaysia Ranked No 1 Most Corrupted Country In The World For Doing Business. The accompanying chart is titled Cost of Doing Business - Percentage of companies that say a competitor's bribery has cost them business in the past year. Text at the bottom appears to credit the information to Transparency International and the financial newspaper the Wall Street Journal. The post, which includes a link to The Coverage's article, is captioned: MALAYSIA MOST CORRUPTED IN THE WORLD? Via The Coverage. Screenshot of the misleading post, taken on July 14, 2022 Malaysia has seen multiple corruption scandals in the past, including the multi-billion dollar 1MDB scheme that contributed to the fall of then prime minister Najib Razak in 2018. The screenshot was also shared alongside a similar claim in English here and here , and in Malaysian here . It was also posted on Twitter here , where it has been retweeted more than 2,800 times. However, the claim is false. Malaysia-based clickbait website The Coverage published similar reports about the Southeast Asia country topping the corruption ranking, at least twice in 2022 -- in January and June -- but with different headlines. Both articles credit the Wall Street Journal in its article. A keyword search found this report, published by the Wall Street Journal on December 11, 2012, headlined: Malaysia Tops Bribery Table. The report cites a survey of corporate executives by global corruption watchdog Transparency International , which found 50 percent in Malaysia had said yes when asked if they thought they had lost a contract in the past year because competitors paid a bribe. The Wall Street Journal's report also includes an identical chart as published in The Coverage's articles. The Coverage's articles are nearly identical with the Wall Street Journal's report. Below are screenshot comparisons of the chart and article in the misleading article (L) and the 2012 Wall Street Journal report (R): Screenshot comparison of the chart from the misleading post (L) and the original Wall Street Journal chart (R) Screenshot comparison of the misleading post (L) and the original Wall Street Journal article (R) The January 2022 version of The Coverage's article also links to a Wall Street Journal video from 2012 about corruption in Malaysia: Corruption index Transparency International told AFP on July 11, 2022 that the last time it ran the survey of businesspeople for the Bribe Payers Index was in November 2011 . AFP found Transparency International had published a blog post here in September 2012 and updated it a month later here with a link to the complete dataset , which was the Wall Street Journal report was based on. Spokesperson Shubham Kaushik said the organisation decided to discontinue the survey due to funding issues and to focus on issues that are more in line with our advocacy goals. The Berlin-based organisation still publishes a Corruption Perceptions Index , which in 2021 ranked Malaysia 62 out of 180 countries. Denmark , Finland and New Zealand were the least corrupt at the top of the index, while South Sudan ranked 180.	https://archive.ph/6U5uh:-:https://archive.ph/kn3Vr:-:https://perma.cc/7JC7-N9B8:-:https://perma.cc/WND3-9L7U:-:https://perma.cc/Y232-T6M6:-:https://web.archive.org/web/20220121025618/https://blog.transparency.org/2012/09/06/bribery-is-bad-for-business/:-:https://web.archive.org/web/20220127074602/https://thecoverage.my/wall-street-journal-malaysia-called-most-corrupt-country-for-business-tops-bribery-table/:-:https://web.archive.org/web/20220623082641/https://www.transparency.org/en/news/putting-corruption-out-of-business:-:https://web.archive.org/web/20220626153630/https://thecoverage.my/wall-street-journal-malaysia-ranked-no-1-most-corrupted-country-in-the-world-for-doing-business/:-:https://www.evernote.com/shard/s709/client/snv?noteGuid=dac01e5b-c259-4982-aaab-805a34ed501b&noteKey=59692c731b09ab7aac8f448b517e47ea&sn=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.evernote.com%2Fshard%2Fs709%2Fsh%2Fdac01e5b-c259-4982-aaab-805a34ed501b%2F59692c731b09ab7aac8f448b517e47ea&title=Facebook:-:https://www.facebook.com/thecoveragemedia/about/:-:https://www.rfi.fr/en/us-jury-convicts-ex-goldman-banker-in-1mdb-scandal:-:https://www.transparency.org/:-:https://www.transparency.org/en/cpi/2021:-:https://www.transparency.org/en/cpi/2021/index/dnk:-:https://www.transparency.org/en/cpi/2021/index/fin:-:https://www.transparency.org/en/cpi/2021/index/mys:-:https://www.transparency.org/en/cpi/2021/index/nzl:-:https://www.transparency.org/en/cpi/2021/index/ssd:-:https://www.transparency.org/en/publications/bribe-payers-index-2011:-:https://www.transparency.org/files/content/feature/2012_PuttingCorruptionOutOfBusiness_FullDataSet.xls:-:https://www.trtworld.com/asia/malaysia-protesters-demand-resignation-of-anti-graft-chief-53946:-:https://www.wsj.com/video/malaysia-called-most-corrupt-country-for-business/84ACA11B-5DE6-4677-828A-CD2D45B60AC6.html	Old Wall Street Journal report about corruption in Malaysia recirculates online								59537	false	, , , , , , , , , , , , , politics_pred, , , , , , ,

Japan and South Korea have long had uneasy diplomatic relations -- and the posts criticise former lawmaker Na Kyung-won for appearing close to Abe. But the image featured in the posts has been doctored: it shows digitally combined photographs of Abe from 2017 and Na from 2011. The doctored image was shared on Facebook on July 10. Korean-language text above the photo translates as: The fact that Na Kyung-won, in sound mind, is crossing arms with Abe shows how deeply she worships Japan. This trash is the floor leader of the Liberty Korea Party. It seems that In Na's views Japan is her mother country and Abe is like a brother from back home. The Liberty Korea Party is the [Japanese ruling] Liberal Democratic Party's puppet. Screenshot of the misleading claim shared on Facebook. Captured July 15, 2022. The post circulated after Abe was shot twice while delivering a stump speech at a campaign rally in Japan's western Nara region on July 8. During his term, Abe pursued a hard line with South Korea over unresolved wartime disputes. Na is a former lawmaker of South Korea's ruling People Power Party, the successor to the Liberty Korea Party, and served as its floor leader from December 2018 to 2019. She has been accused by some in South Korea of harbouring pro-Japanese views, in part due to her attendance at a 2004 ceremony commemorating the foundation of The Japan Self-Defense Forces held in Seoul in 2011. The doctored image was also shared on Facebook here , here , here and here . Abe's photo A reverse image search on Google found the part of the doctored image showing Abe corresponds to a photo of the former premier alongside his wife published here by South Korean news agency Newsis on May 28, 2017. Screenshot of the original photograph of Abe and his wife published by Newsis on May 28, 2017. Captured July 15, 2022. The caption of the photo, credited to AP, reads, As part of his trip to attend the G7 summit, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and his wife Akie walk to attend an orchestra performance at an ancient Greek theatre in Taormina, Italy, on the 26th. The doctored photograph appears to be a mirror image of the original. Below is a screenshot comparison of the doctored image (left) and the photo published by Newsis (right), with corresponding sections marked in red: Screenshot comparison of the doctored image shared on Facebook (left) and the original AP/Newsis photo featuring Abe and his wife (right), with corresponding sections marked in red by AFP. Abe's photo has been flipped horizontally. Abe attended the 2017 G7 summit , hosted by Italy in the southern city of Taormina from May 26 to 27. AFP also captured several photographs of Abe and his wife attending the orchestra performance on May 26, 2017, as seen here and here . Na's photo Through a separate reverse image search on Google, AFP was able to trace the section of the doctored photograph corresponding to Na to a report published by The Fact, a South Korean news organisation, on October 25, 2011. The report includes a collage of two images showing Na with former South Korean President Park Geun-hye, with the image on the left corresponding to Na's picture in the doctored photo shared on Facebook. The photos' caption reads: On the 25th, a day before the by-election for Seoul Mayor, former party leader Park Geun-hye and candidate Na Kyung-won walk the streets after their meeting at Na's campaign office at the Seoul Press Center.

However, the claim is false. The photo has previously circulated in Indonesian news reports from October 2020 about a wedding tent collapsing. The reports said there were no casualties. The photo, which appears to show a large tent that has collapsed, was shared here on July 12, 2022 in a Facebook group with more than 40,000 members. The post's Indonesian-language caption reads: Verily to Allah We Belong and to Allah We Shall Return. A wedding party turns into a tragedy, 37 people dead including the bride and the groom on the spot. May they rest in peace. Screenshot of the misleading post, taken on July 18, 2022 The post shares a link of a July 2022 Indonesian-language blog article that has the same title as the Facebook post's caption. A happy moment suddenly turned to sadness. A wedding party brimming with happiness suddenly turned into a tragedy after a disaster happened, reads the first paragraph of the post. It says a brick wall collapsed at a wedding party in China's Fujian province, killing 37 people. The photo appeared in other July 2022 blog posts alongside a similar claim here and here , and in other Facebook posts here , here and here . However, the photo has been shared in a false context. Indonesian wedding tent collapse A reverse image search on Google led to a report by Berita Manado , an online news portal based in Manado , the capital of Indonesia's North Sulawesi province. The report, published on October 18, 2020, said the incident occurred in the province's North Bolaang Mongondow regency. Viral! Video Shows Moments Wedding Tent Collapses, Almost Falls on North Bolaang Mongondow Deputy Regent Amin Lasena, reads the report's headline. Below is a screenshot of the photo in the Berita Manado news report: Screenshot of the photo in the Berita Manado news report The article also embedded a video of the incident. Indonesian television station Kompas TV also published footage from the incident here on its YouTube channel on October 19, 2020, titled: Strong Wind Causes Party Tent to Collapse, Guests to Scatter. Rain and strong wind in North Bolaang Mongondow regency, North Sulawesi caused a party tent to collapse. There were no casualties in this incident, the video's description partly reads.

Below is a comparison of the photo in the misleading posts (left) and a frame from the Kompas TV footage (right): Wedding accident in China A keyword search for wedding casualties in China's southeastern Fujian province led to this report by state-owned broadcaster CCTV on June 22, 2021. In Shanghang county, Longyan city, Fujian province, a brick wall fell, killing nine people and injuring seven others, reads the report's Chinese-language headline. The report reads in part: On June 22, at approximately 11:40 am, a group of people in Nanyang Village Group 13, Nanyang town, Shanghang county, Longyan city, Fujian province, had set up a banquet in an alley between the front and back of two homes. A sunshade cloth was attached to the two rooftops. Due to excess pressure on one side pulling on the surrounding brick wall of the roof, it collapsed and caused nine deaths and seven injuries. AFP found no official reports about 37 people dying during a wedding reception in Fujian province as of July 20, 2022.	http://www.xhby.net/index/202106/t20210622_7132897.shtml:-:https://archive.ph/Zs1m9:-:https://archive.ph/bre9H:-:https://archive.ph/gK3GX:-:https://archive.ph/yZfxF:-:https://beritamanado.com/:-:https://beritamanado.com/viral-video-detik-detik-tenda-pernikahan-roboh-yang-nyaris-timpa-wabup-bolmut-amin-lasena/:-:https://goo.gl/maps/hKvQ512nmnmq5dNp6:-:https://perma.cc/9PM5-ZJQK:-:https://perma.cc/BKG7-33V4:-:https://perma.cc/RG3N-FTM5:-:https://www.google.com/maps/place/Kabupaten+Bolaang+Mongondow+Utara,+Sulawesi+Utara/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x327ebff0b8ae5adb:0x3030bfbcaf77220?sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiQ-YqVg_r4AhX42jgGHQLgCa8Q8gF6BAhkEAE:-:https://www.google.com/maps/place/Manado,+Manado+City,+North+Sulawesi,+Indonesia/@1.5408156,124.7844865,12z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x32879ef9ffb30fd3:0x3030bfbcaf77280!8m2!3d1.4748305!4d124.8420794:-:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEShRHsQ7x0:-:https://youtu.be/e6XNqYd6V8s	Photo shows wedding tent that collapsed in Indonesia, not 'deadly wedding accident in China'								59539	false	, , covid_pred, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , 
59540	2.0	1.0	5.0	misleading	Candidates of Osun 2022 Governorship Election	2022-07-06		factcheck_afp	https://factcheck.afp.com/segun-olakoyenikan:-:https://factcheck.afp.com/tonye-bakare:-:https://factcheck.afp.com/afp-nigeria	https://factcheck.afp.com/doc.afp.com.32EG4QN	Nigeria Osun state has five mining licences operated by the Chinese	2022-07-15	factcheck_afp	Segun Olakoyenikan:-:Tonye BAKARE:-:AFP Nigeria	Voters in Osun, a key state in Nigeria's southwest, will choose their governor for a four-year term on July 16, 2022. This marks the last major election before the country goes to the polls next February to elect a new president. Ahead of Saturday's ballot, several debates have been held among the leading candidates, including the two front runners — incumbent Adegboyega Oyetola of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) and Ademola Adeleke of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP). AFP Fact Check has spot-checked claims made by the various contenders and found some to be false. Osun is seen as a crucial battleground for next year's election when Nigerians elect a successor to President Muhammadu Buhari along with state and federal MPs and governors. Incumbent Oyetola defeated PDP's Adeleke during the last ballot in 2018. Other candidates running this year include Akin Ogunbiyi of the Accord Party, Yusuf Lasun of the Labour Party (LP) and Goke Omigbodun of the Social Democratic Party (SDP). In a debate held on July 6, 2022, Accord Party’s Ogunbiyi alleged the state government has five [mining] licences which are operated in partnership with the Chinese. He also said Osun has 26 commercially viable solid minerals. SDP’s Omigbodun then claimed during a discussion about health services that 47% of people in Osun state live below the poverty line, the worst in the federation. And, at an earlier debate organised by BBC Yoruba, Lasun of the Labour Party said he had passed the 30, 000-naira minimum wage bill which the Senate only concurred. But all these claims are either false or misleading. Osun's mining licences The crisis that we have in the mining sector is a creation of the government. This government has five licences. Instead of partnering with internationally recognised mining companies, they chose to partner with [the] Chinese, Ogunbiyi claimed during the debate hosted by Arise TV on July 6. The Nigerian Mineral and Mining Act of 2007 put the ownership and control of mineral resources found in commercial quantities in the hands of the federal government, which can, in turn, issue licences to interested parties. Information provided by Nigeria’s Ministry of Mines and Steel Development on valid mining titles in the country shows that while Osun indeed has five licences, only one is affiliated to the state government. Screenshots showing details of valid mining titles in Osun Two of the licences belong to the Nigerian Mining Corporation and another two are owned by private entities, including Nigerian-Canadian Segilola Resources Operating Limited. The remaining licence is operated by Omoluabi Mineral Promotion Company Limited under a public-private partnership with the Osun state government. Illegal mining of solid minerals without approval, or with expired and fabricated licences, is a big problem in Osun, where security operatives have repeatedly arrested several Chinese nationals and locals. However, the illegal miners are not legitimate Chinese licence holders. Viable solid minerals If you look at the mining sector... we have 26 commercially viable solid minerals in Osun, Ogunbiyi said. We have not been able to have any investment strategy, any cohesive strategy to ensure that we take maximum advantage of this. Although Osun has an abundance of natural resources, there is no evidence to show it is home to such large commercial quantities of solid minerals. The latest solid minerals investment brochure published by the mines and steel ministry in 2017 revealed there are only nine mineral resources possibly in commercial quantities. The ministry listed the solid minerals as clay, granite, talc, dolomite, feldspar, quartz, limestone, mica, and gold. Osun’s poverty rate The election debates also focused on the health sector. Candidates for instance were asked about their plans to address health challenges in the state, including rising cases of infant mortality. Omigbodun explored the link between health problems and poverty, claiming that right now in Osun state, about 47 percent of the people live below the poverty line, which is one of the worst in the federation. However, data provided by Nigeria’s National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) shows that Osun had a poverty rate of 8.52 percent as of 2019 when the last Nigerian Living Standards Survey (NLSS) was conducted by the statistics office. AFP Fact Check found that Osun’s poverty rate was the lowest in the country, after Delta and Lagos. NLSS is the official survey providing the basis for measuring poverty and living standards in Nigeria, according to the NBS. It puts the national poverty rate at 40.09 percent against Omigbodun’s 42.6 percent claim. Poverty is measured using consumption expenditures rather than income in Nigeria — similar to the approach taken by many other countries globally, reads the survey’s report. It further defines the poor as those whose consumption value is below 137,430 naira ($330) a year. Minimum wage bill vote Lasun, a former deputy speaker of Nigeria’s House of Representatives, said at the debate hosted by BBC Yoruba on June 30 that he passed the minimum wage bill.

This is false. The clip has circulated in news reports about members of a family that were swept away by waves near Oman's Al Mughsail beach. Authorities in the sultanate said at least three people were found dead and two were declared missing following the accident , local media reported. The video was shared on Facebook here on July 12, 2022. It appears to show people posing on a rocky shoreline just before a wave crashes over them, dragging at least two people into the sea. The post's English-language caption reads: Alibagh. Near Mumbai. Because of the selfie.. With their backs towards the water.. These girls. Be careful of water, even streams, small puddles, could take your life. Spread it around, specially young ones.. Many friends have been lost to drowning during picnics. A screenshot of the misleading post, taken on July 15, 2022 The video circulated online as parts of western India, including Mumbai in Maharashtra state, witnessed torrential monsoon rains in July. Deadly floods and heavy downpours hit Maharashtra's third largest city of Nagpur and in the western state of Gujarat, English-language daily The Hindustan Times reported on July 13. The video was also shared alongside a similar claim in Hindi-language posts on Facebook here and here . However, the claim is false: the video has circulated in reports about a family being swept into the sea in Oman. Beach tragedy According to a report by UAE-based English-language newspaper Gulf News, an expat family of eight was swept away by strong waves at Al Mughsail beach on July 10. The Civil Defence and Ambulance Authority (CDAA) said it managed to rescue only three of them and are looking for the five, the report stated. It also shared a tweet by a user with the handle @WeatherOman that included part of the video. The Arabic-language tweet reads: The drowning accident involving an Asian family in Al Mughsail due to the force of the waves after they crossed the safety barrier! The Gulf News report added that all tourist sites across the sultanate were temporarily closed after the country dealt with unstable weather conditions. A report by the Bahrain-based Gulf Daily News on July 13 said two people had been found dead following the accident. Search and rescue teams were still trying to locate the other three members of the family, the news outlet reported. The Gulf Daily News also tweeted the video, with the caption: The Royal Oman Police continued their search on Tuesday for three missing members of a family of eight who were swept into the sea by strong currents. Below is a screenshot comparison of the video shared on Facebook (left) and the video tweeted by Gulf Daily News (right): Several other local media outlets also reported on the incident, including Al Arabia and the Times of Oman. There have been no official reports of people drowning in Alibagh while taking selfies during the monsoon rains there as of July 19.	http://hindustantimes.com/india-news/monsoon-live-updates-weather-forecast-latest-rain-news-july-13-101657676751084.html:-:https://english.alarabiya.net/News/gulf/2022/07/12/Oman-authorities-continue-search-for-family-swept-into-sea-two-members-reported-dead:-:https://goo.gl/maps/HTPxo2zoFrREUBmL9:-:https://gulfnews.com/world/gulf/oman/video-8-member-expat-family-swept-away-by-strong-waves-in-oman-1.89181579:-:https://perma.cc/UN8G-RKZ2?:-:https://timesofoman.com/article/119004-search-continues-for-four-people-missing-at-mughsail-beach:-:https://twitter.com/GDNonline/status/1547217598290485250:-:https://twitter.com/WeatherOman/status/1546369426076868608:-:https://www.evernote.com/shard/s26/client/snv?noteGuid=45677708-6632-46f8-9f9d-78ebfd42b000&noteKey=022a2074c98c067187bbcefd083a8f7c&sn=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.evernote.com%2Fshard%2Fs26%2Fsh%2F45677708-6632-46f8-9f9d-78ebfd42b000%2F022a2074c98c067187bbcefd083a8f7c&title=Facebook:-:https://www.evernote.com/shard/s322/sh/87ee0376-0427-412e-a59a-3166b582c884/b50b3e61671b9c8b5a6d7936f4f4a5cb:-:https://www.gdnonline.com/Details/1127307/VIDEO-Omani-authorities-search-for-expat-family-members-who-were-swept-into-the-sea:-:https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/rain-relief-delhi-ncr-18-dead-maharashtra-gujarat-mp-karnataka-telangana-mumbai-weather-1974934-2022-07-13	Video shows tragic beach accident in Oman, not India								59541	false	, , , , , , , environment & climate_pred, , , , , , , , , , , , ,

But the posts are misleading; the original article did not predict imminent threats to coastal cities from sea-level rise, and experts say observations from 1922 do not disprove the effects of human-caused global warming on polar ecosystems. Within a few years it is predicted that due to the ice melt the sea will rise and make most coast cities uninhabitable, says text in a June 1, 2022 Facebook post . The post goes on to claim the text stems from an Arctic exploration report that was reported and published in the Washington Post in 1922. Screenshot of a Facebook post taken July 15, 2022 The century-old article has been circulating on Facebook for years , often accompanying posts that dismiss scientific assessments and calls to action. Parts of the report have also been published on websites that have previously spread climate misinformation, including Watts Up with That? The report is authentic; it describes the warming of the ocean, icebergs growing scarcer and glaciers that have entirely disappeared. But the projections about sea levels rising and uninhabitable coasts, quoted in the social media posts, did not appear in the original version. So we have a situation where something real and actually interesting is found in the archives, it gets misrepresented as a 'gotcha' talking point, but someone thinks it can be made 'better' and so adds a fake last line to sex it up, wrote Gavin Schmidt , director of the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies, in a 2014 blog post responding to the misinformation. 'Drastic' change in sea ice A search of The Washington Post's archives showed the report cited in the social media posts was published November 2, 1922. The clip is attributed to the Associated Press and cites observations from Norwegian explorers during an expedition. The report does not undermine the scientific consensus on human-caused global warming. A screenshot shows a report about an Arctic exploration, published November 2, 1922 in The Washington Post ( ProQuest Historical Newspapers / The Washington Post / The Associated Press / ) Temperatures are increasing in every region on Earth, according to the latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report , which is put together by more than 700 scientists from 90 different countries. Warming in the Arctic is more than twice as high as the global average, scientists noted . Kate Moran , president of the University of Victoria's Ocean Networks Canada, an organization that monitors Arctic data, told AFP that ice variations reported 100 years ago are not comparable to those observed today. She said data from 1922 shows heavy, concentrated sea ice (multi-year), which is drastically different from today where there is very little multi-year ice and extent. We are in a climate emergency and the Arctic is warming faster and greater than almost any place on the planet, Moran said, pointing to observable sea ice loss and sea-level rise, glacial ice loss and extreme heat in the ocean. We have not seen this drastic of a change in perennial sea ice for over 15 million years. In 1922, Moran said, these impacts from climate change were not yet observable, although the greenhouse effect and its potential had been known since the late 1800s. Report reflects weather, technology Asked about the observations in the 1922 report, Jayantha Obeysekera, director of the Sea Level Solutions Center at Florida International University, told AFP: It seems like what was observed at that time was a localized phenomenon and not Arctic-wide. Sridhar Anandakrishnan , a glaciologist and professor of geosciences at The Pennsylvania State University, also said the observations in the report were not unheard of, or unexpected. Warm years in the past did happen -- prior to the enormous effects of human-caused CO2 increase and warming, Anandakrishnan said. They were part of the natural variability of the climate system that we are all familiar with. Change in the Arctic sea ice area in October, compared to the average area in October from 1981 to 2010 ( AFP / Simon MALFATTO, Sabrina BLANCHARD) Experts also told AFP that explorers who reported on Arctic conditions 100 years ago would have had access to far inferior technology. In 1922, measuring and monitoring the seas and oceans was done by vessels that were actually there -- and on land by people traveling there, Anandakrishnan said. Their view of the world was accurate as far as it went but didn't have the scope of global access we have today from satellite imagery, buoys, floats, aircraft, long-term weather stations, etc. In addition, we now have much better modeling and projection capability. Claire Parkinson , a senior climate change scientist at the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center agreed. Because satellites now allow us to monitor the full expanse of the sea ice cover every day, the statistics are overwhelmingly more complete now than would have been feasible in 1922, she said. Past observations do not change the fact that the warming we're experiencing now could lead to troublesome problems, for instance through sea-level rise, she said. AFP has previously fact-checked other claims that manipulate or misrepresent data about warming in the Arctic, here , here and here .	https://perma.cc/4FM6-4ENE?view-mode=server-side&type=image:-:https://perma.cc/95UA-DF62?view-mode=server-side&type=image:-:https://perma.cc/D2A9-WWKU:-:https://perma.cc/HDJ7-JFPZ:-:https://perma.cc/HJE3-9RXS?view-mode=server-side&type=image:-:https://perma.cc/L33P-4GXV?view-mode=server-side&type=image:-:https://perma.cc/L7GD-7NRR?view-mode=server-side&type=image:-:https://perma.cc/L8EX-5XLL:-:https://perma.cc/LX5P-ZACE:-:https://perma.cc/MTB6-ZRN6?view-mode=server-side&type=image:-:https://perma.cc/N67N-68D3?view-mode=server-side&type=image:-:https://perma.cc/R3UW-EVRM:-:https://perma.cc/U7XR-UB9E:-:https://www.ipcc.ch/:-:https://www.oceannetworks.ca/about-onc/our-people/leadership/#	Century-old Arctic report altered to discredit global warming	['climate']						{'environment & climate'}	59542	mixture	, , , , , , , environment & climate_pred, , , , , , , , , , , , ,

Although local media reported the bridge's construction was reaching its final stages in mid-July, the images have been shared in a false context. The images -- which have been manipulated to insert Bangladeshi flags -- show a bridge that connects Russia to the annexed Black Sea peninsula of Crimea. The two photos were shared on Facebook here on July 2, 2022. They are almost an exact mirror image of each other. The post's Bengali-language caption translates to English as: Kalna Bridge awaiting its inauguration. The six-lane Kalna Bridge over the Madhumati River is going to be launched very soon. More than 90 percent of the construction work has been completed. If the bridge is opened, the distance from Dhaka to Khulna will be reduced by 121 km (75 miles). The distance between Dhaka and Kolkata will be reduced by 200 km (124 miles). Screenshot of the misleading Facebook post, taken on July 17, 2022 The construction of the Kalna Bridge -- which will connect the southwestern districts of Narail and Gopalganj -- entered its final stages in mid-July, according to the English-language daily the Dhaka Tribune. The bridge is set to shorten travelling times through the southern part of Bangladesh when it opens to traffic in September 2022, the newspaper reported. The new link will be opened shortly after Bangladesh inaugurated a new bridge near its capital Dhaka in late June, ending an economic bottleneck that required freight destined for the poverty-stricken south and the Indian megacity of Kolkata to be slowly ferried over the Padma river. The images were also shared here and here on Facebook alongside a similar claim. However, the images show a bridge in Crimea. Crimean bridge A reverse image search on Google found the original photo shared in this tweet published on May 14, 2018 by Russia's Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Crimea.

Although Rajapaksa and his wife did flee the island nation for the Maldives by military aircraft on July 13, the video has been shared in a misleading context. AFP found an earlier version of the clip that does not include the sound of a man heckling Rajapaksa in Tamil-language. The original footage actually shows the now-disgraced leader arriving in Sri Lanka in 2017, more than two years before he was elected president. The one-minute 19-second video was shared in this Facebook post on July 13, 2022. It has been viewed more than 4,000 times. The post's Sinhala-language caption translates to English as: The Maldivians have extended a warm welcome to Mr Gotabaya. In the clip, a male voice can be heard berating the former Sri Lankan President in Tamil-language, one of the official languages of Sri Lanka. His comments in part translate to English as: You low-life! How much money have we wasted on you! How much of our money have you wasted on good food and enjoy luxuries? The first 40 seconds of the video show Rajapaksa leaving a building with his wife and several other people. At the video's 41-second mark, it cuts to different footage of what appears to be protesters inside Sri Lanka's colonial-era presidential palace after they stormed it on July 9. The footage is similar to other user-generated content verified by AFP of protesters storming the palace on July 9. AFP reported on the events here . Screenshot of the Facebok post captured on June 17, 2022 The video in the misleading post circulated online on the same day Rajapaksa fled to the Maldives following months of anti-government protests. He later flew to Singapore on July 14 before officially resigning the next day. Six-time premier Ranil Wickremesinghe was elected president by Sri Lanka's parliament on July 20, AFP reported . The same video was shared repeatedly alongside a similar claim in multiple Facebook posts here , here and here . The claim is misleading; the video featuring Rajapaksa is from 2017, more than two years before he was elected president. Unrelated clip A closer analysis of the video found it was taken from local television channel Ada Derana. The channel's logo appears in the top right-hand corner of the frame. A keyword search on Google subsequently found this news clip from October 17, 2017, which includes footage that directly corresponds with the first 40 seconds of the video in the misleading posts. The corresponding section begins from the YouTube video's 28-second mark. The YouTube video's title reads: Rumours disspelled; Gotabaya Rajapaksa returns to Sri Lanka. The video refers to speculation in 2017 that the former defence secretary would be arrested over an alleged misappropriation of state funds following the construction of the D.A. Rajapaksa memorial and museum in southern Sri Lanka -- an establishment constructed to remember his father. Speaking in Sinhala, the narrator says although there were rumours that Rajapaksa would be arrested as soon as he arrived in Sri Lanka following a trip to the US, he was not detained. According to the clip, the footage was filmed as Rajapaksa left Bandaranaike International Airport. In contrast to the misleading posts, the earlier footage does not contain audio of a man heckling Rajapaksa in Tamil-language. Below are screenshot comparisons of keyframes in the misleading video (left) and the YouTube video (right): Screenshot comparison of the keyframes of the misleading video (L) and the Youtube video (R) At the 28-second mark of the YouTube video, former Sri Lankan minister Nalaka Godahewa can be seen walking alongside Rajapaksa.

The claim is false. The video has circulated in news reports about a confrontation between Indonesian authorities and local residents -- not Chinese soldiers -- when police tried to arrest suspected illegal miners in Indonesia's Aceh province. The 49-second clip was posted on Facebook here on June 30, 2022. It appears to show an altercation between a large group of people, some of whom are wearing Indonesian police and army uniforms. The post's Indonesian-language caption translates to English as: Chinese soldiers have started to act, have dared to fight our soldiers. Because they have already started carrying individual weapons.. They have started to act as a small group. The reason is to secure their assets.. Palm oil plantations and others... that is the excuse but they actually want to show that Chinese soldiers have already taken control of the area.. The Indonesian military and national police can't do anything, they are just spectators in their own country, it's heartbreaking. Screenshot of the misleading post, taken on July 19, 2022 The video has been viewed more than 17,000 times in similar Facebook posts here , here , here and here , and on YouTube here . However, the claim is false. 'Not Chinese soldiers' A reverse image search and keyword searches on Google found the video published here in a report by Indonesian news outlet Detikcom on June 29, 2022. The article's Indonesian-language headline translates to English as: Police Officers Blocked by Residents While Attempting to Arrest Illegal Miners. According to the report, the video shows local police officers being blocked by residents as they tried to arrest people suspected of illegal mining in Geumpang , a district in the Pidie regency of Indonesia's Aceh province . The video was also posted here on Detikcom's YouTube channel the following day. The video in the news report is credited to an Indonesian Twitter user who uploaded the clip here on June 29, 2022. Translated to English, the tweet reads: It is said that this took place in Aceh...don't know what all the pushing around is about. They are also carrying long barrels. Scary. Below is a screenshot comparison of the video in the misleading post (left) and the video from Twitter (right): Screenshot comparison of the video in the misleading post (left) and the video on Twitter (right) Alfath Asmunda, an AFP stringer based in Aceh, reported on the incident here for Indonesian news website Merdeka.com. The article includes a screenshot from the video. Those were not Chinese soldiers, he told AFP when contacted on July 15, 2022. He said that the video shows the confrontation that took place between police and army officers and members of the local community in Geumpang district in Pidie. The Aceh police released an official statement about the incident here on July 1, 2022. The altercation was also reported on by other news outlets here , here and here .

But the photo actually shows a French-born Russian-American journalist pictured in an interview in 2019. A prominent cardiologist told AFP there was no evidence that the heart supplement cited in the posts has notable benefits. AFP found no evidence that the Burmese cardiologist named in the posts exists. The photo of a bald man sitting at a table was published in a blog post shared here on Facebook on July 16, 2022. The Facebook post's Burmese-language caption translates to English as: It can cure hypertension and it will never come back. The blog post includes an interview with a cardiologist identified as Kyaw Thu Maung. Age is not a hindrance in life, the Burmese-language title reads. A 109-year-old cardiologist shared his secret to a healthy and long life. The photo caption translates as: The president congratulated U Kyaw Thu Maung when he turned 109. A picture shows him at his office. The blog post concludes by saying that a person's blood vessels should be cleaned to promote good health and recommends taking a supplement called Cardiovax, saying it is the secret to the cardiologist's excellent health. The same image has been shared hundreds of times alongside a similar claim on Facebook here , here and here , and in other blog posts here , and here . The same photo has also been used in materials in English and Indonesian promoting supplements by other names. '109-year-old cardiologist' AFP found no evidence that an 109-year-old Burmese cardiologist named Kyaw Thu Maung really exists. A reverse image search on Google found the man in the photo published in reports about a French-born Russian-American journalist. The same photo was published in an article here by the government for Russia's Tatarstan region on September 28, 2019. It identifies the man in the photo as Vladimir Pozner, who was interviewed about language policies in the region. The interview was also posted on Pozner's personal website . Tatarstan-based news agency Tatar Inform also posted a video of the interview here . Below is a screenshot comparison of the photo in the misleading posts (left) to the photo on the Tatarstan government's website (right): 'No benefits' Cardiovax 's manufacturer -- Vokin Biotech -- claims on its website that studies have shown the drug will reduce inflammation and improve the health of blood vessels' inner (endothelial) linings. But the manufacturer, which is listed in India, does not give specifics of the studies. The manufacturer also lists lycopene as an ingredient and says the powerful antioxidant has many health benefits. However, Dorairaj Prabhakaran, chair of the World Heart Federation's Science Committee, told AFP that there is no evidence that Cardiovax is beneficial. He said while antioxidants have shown to be useful in treating chronic disease such as heart disease when consumed as part of a healthy diet, extracts as pills or supplements have not shown to be of benefit in large clinical trials. Eating a healthy, balanced diet that includes plenty of fresh and whole foods is the best way to obtain necessary nutrients and key to preventing cardiovascular disease. The US Food & Drug Administration's list of approved drugs also does not contain a product with the name Cardiovax.	https://perma.cc/7LQM-ASJW:-:https://pozneronline.ru/2019/09/26380/:-:https://tatar-congress.org/en/news/vladimir-pozner-you-cant-deprive-a-person-of-his-native-language/:-:https://vokinbiotech.com/collections/cardiovascular/products/vokin-biotech-natural-cardiovax-with-arjuna-extract-moringa-extract-60-tablets:-:https://world-heart-federation.org/:-:https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cder/daf/index.cfm?event=browseByLetter.page&productLetter=C&ai=0:-:https://www.evernote.com/shard/s450/sh/13e27be6-500b-471d-af1a-f2844bd21816/9f940eb0a66bf3cedfe32fa55c56efb0:-:https://www.evernote.com/shard/s450/sh/3369c0fe-7d8d-412a-ad8f-1594366feb40/54e41bb3d8b8ce083af90f6ec5d51695:-:https://www.evernote.com/shard/s450/sh/4f52676c-f58d-4585-844d-eddefb6ff447/7d1bb73a0cb2d44321fe4c5d258f492e:-:https://www.evernote.com/shard/s450/sh/521986de-b182-43ac-83ed-120f78a9f82c/8490309cf66317057d9a61a3219c9db5:-:https://www.evernote.com/shard/s450/sh/99828dc4-abbe-4515-afa0-4b4ae69a638e/d011abb8ec404d8e2130d05d91b2986a:-:https://www.evernote.com/shard/s450/sh/a85d43f8-66ba-4827-b4e2-efe571ebb0f3/8bfb84a330fa616b57df241bde1a99be:-:https://www.evernote.com/shard/s450/sh/d52bb41f-f24b-46da-82eb-62c34d2ee4cd/c0483ecb9bba65bc40543f7f8ca48968:-:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-hYHq5rZkU&ab_channel=%D0%A2%D0%B0%D1%82%D0%B0%D1%80-%D0%B8%D0%BD%D1%84%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%BC	Photo of journalist misrepresented as 'cardiologist promoting herbal supplement in Myanmar'								59547	false	, , covid_pred, , , , , , , , health_pred, , military_pred, , , , , , , ,

However, the claim is false; neither race nor religion are conditions for citizenship in Malaysia under the Constitution, while a legal expert called the claim ignorant and prejudiced. The claim was shared as an image on Facebook here on June 9, 2022. Its Malaysian-language caption translates as: So that foreigners know these are the conditions to become citizens of Malaysia. Why don’t Malaysian Chinese and Indians want to accept it? The disjointed Malaysian-language text in the image claims conditions to become a Malaysian citizen include being of the Malay ethnicity or originating from Southeast Asia or the Malay Archipelago , referring to a cluster of more than 17,000 islands, which includes parts of Malaysia, as well as Indonesia and the Philippines. It continues to claim that spouses must be Muslim if they are seeking citizenship. The claim also states that Chinese and Indian people who do not come from the Southeast Asia region cannot become citizens and are only eligible for permanent residency, as well as cannot participate in politics unless they are Muslim or married to a Malaysian Muslim citizen of the Malay ethnicity. Screenshot of the misleading Facebook post taken on July 18, 2022 The claim circulated as a Malaysian court was set to decide on an appeal by the government against a High Court ruling in September 2021 that found a rule preventing women married to foreign spouses from passing on citizenship to their children was unconstitutional . The government has challenged that court ruling, and the Court of Appeal is set to hand down a ruling on August 5, 2022, local media reported . The claim was also shared on Facebook here , here and here . However, the claim is false; the Constitution of Malaysia does not include race or religion as a condition for gaining citizenship. 'Ignorant, populist views' The Facebook post is, understandably, a mixture of ignorance, populist views, and racist and religious prejudices, said Dr Shad Saleem Faruqi , an emeritus professor at the University of Malaya's Faculty of Law. Under the Federal Constitution, race and religion are nowhere prescribed as requirements for citizenship. Millions of non-Malays and non-Muslims are citizens of the country, he told AFP on July 2, 2022. The constitutional expert dismissed the claim that a person must be of the Malay race from Southeast Asia or the Malay Archipelago. Malaysia has long grouped its indigenous tribes under the same category as people of Malay ethnicity called bumiputera -- a phrase not used in the constitution -- but Shad Saleem said those in the East Malaysian states of Sabah and Sarawak might question this idea of a Malay lineage. The claim that foreigners who are Muslims would be eligible for citizenship was very unclear and mostly wrong, Shad Saleem said, adding that the religion did not guarantee citizensip. Becoming a Malaysian citizen Jasmine Wong , a senior associate at the law firm MahWengKwai & Associates, explained the four avenues to becoming a Malaysian citizen. The first is citizenship by operation of law -- also called citizenship by birth and descent. These include: people born in Malaysia to at least one parent who is a citizen or permanent resident at the time of birth; those born outside of the country to a father who is a citizen and whose birth is registered within one year; a person born in Singapore to at least one parent who is a citizen; and a person born in Malaysia but who is not born a citizen of any other country. There are various issues with the legal interpretations of the above and citizenship is not a straightforward matter, she told AFP. The second method is by registration: a foreign wife who is married to a Malaysian husband, stayed in Malaysia for at least two years and is of good character; any person under the age of 21 with at least one parent who is a citizen; or any children below the age of 21 if there are special circumstances. However, Wong noted that the special circumstances are not defined anywhere. Shad Saleem also said this method excludes foreign men who marry Malaysian women. A person can also become a citizen by naturalisation, where the government may grant citizenship if the person has stayed in Malaysia for a minimum of 10 years and intends to live permanently in the country, is of good character and has an adequate grasp of the Malaysian language. The last method is citizenship by incorporation of territory under which any residents in land acquired by Malaysia would be granted citizenship, which Wong said was no longer relevant today. However, she said the complicated nature of citizenship laws meant that local courts and the National Registration Department (JPN) have taken different approaches and interpretations when deciding whether to grant citizenship to a person. Political participation Despite the claim that people of Indian and Chinese descent were barred from politics, Malaysia has political parties based on those ethnicities, such as the Malaysian Indian Congress and the Malaysian Chinese Association , which are part of the ruling coalition. According to Shad Saleem, the claim is not based on law but is mischievous and racist.	http://www.commonlii.org/my/legis/const/1957/3.html:-:http://www.mca.org.my/:-:https://archive.ph/5kNI8:-:https://goo.gl/maps/fc6WQbcQytVfKEwK8:-:https://mahwengkwai.com/lawyers/jasmine-wong/:-:https://mic.org.my/:-:https://perma.cc/GWX3-4TDG:-:https://perma.cc/Q8EK-XT6G:-:https://perma.cc/TP56-PB2W:-:https://perma.cc/Z2VG-LQYR:-:https://umexpert.um.edu.my/shad-saleem-faruqi:-:https://web.archive.org/web/20220630082928/https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/aug-5-verdict-govts-appeal-citizenship-children-born-overseas-malaysian-mothers:-:https://www.britannica.com/place/Malay-Archipelago:-:https://www.britannica.com/place/Southeast-Asia:-:https://www.jpn.gov.my/en:-:https://www.lawinsider.com/dictionary/bumiputera	Legal experts rubbish 'ignorant' social media posts about 'conditions for Malaysian citizenship'								59548	false	Immigration_pred, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,

In reality, the video shows a fire near an archaeological park in Rome . AFP found no reports of the incident described in posts. The video was viewed over 24,000 times since it was shared on Twitter on July 12. It appears to have been filmed from a moving vehicle and shows thick black smoke obscuring a portion of the distant blue sky. The caption of the video in simplified Chinese translates in part as: The Vatican witnessed a fire that covered the sky on July 10, 2022. Thick black smoke filled the sky. It is said that even the Vatican's underground passages were engulfed in flames, leading many netizens to believe that the world had ended. Screenshot of the false post taken on July 18, 2022 The post circulated online as multiple fires broke out in Rome in July. However, there were no reports of fires in July in the Vatican.

Whilst police in Telangana's district of Jagtial told AFP that a journalist drowned in the flood, the clip has been shared in a false context. It has circulated online since September 2020 in posts about a vehicle being swept by flooding in neighbouring Pakistan. The video also includes other elements that indicate it was filmed in Pakistan, including a vehicle with a Pakistani license plate, as well as someone speaking in Urdu-language. The video was shared on July 13 on a YouTube channel for local news organisation 14 TV Telugu. Its caption states in part: TV reporter away [sic] in flood water in Jagtial. The post circulated online after police in the city of Jagtial said a journalist drowned while reporting on floods in Telangana. Local media reported on the incident here . Screenshot of the false post taken August 1, 2022 The video was viewed more than one million times alongside a similar claim here and here on Twitter; and here and here on YouTube. Several Telangana-based media outlets published the video in recent reports about flooding in the state, including 14tv Telugu and TV45 Telugu . Comments indicate some social media users were misled by the posts and reports. One wrote, NTV journalist will be missed. Another said, Telangana chief minister warned against doing such acts during rains. The video, however, predates the journalist's death in Telangana. Pakistan flood A reverse search of keyframes combined with Google keyword searches found the footage was previously published here by Urdu-language newspaper Daily Jiddat Karachi on March 25, 2020. The report says the accident happened in the district of Harnai in Pakistan's sparsely-populated Balochistan province. The Urdu-language caption translates to English as: Breaking News: There are reports of a dam burst in Harnai. There is a flood in the town. Flood water has turned towards Sibbi, the local population is at risk.

However, the video has previously circulated online in posts about lions roaming through a game reserve in South Africa. A representative for the MalaMala Game Reserve in South Africa told AFP the video was shot there and not in India. The video has been viewed over 5,000 times since it was posted on Facebook on July 8, 2022. Its caption states in part: Lions Crossing Roads Submerged by Rainwater, a wonderful walk of a big group of Asiatic lions in Junagadh Gir Enjoy. I'm sure you are viewing such wonderful Moments for the First Time. Junagadh is a district in Gujarat located near the Gir National Park -- the last remaining natural habitat of India's endangered Asiatic lions. The majestic big cats , slightly smaller than their African cousins and with a fold of skin along their bellies, were once found widely across southwest Asia. The post circulated as heavy monsoon rains lashed areas of Gujarat and caused floods, the Hindustan Times newspaper reported . Screenshot of the misleading Facebook post, taken on July 14, 2022 The identical video was also shared alongside a similar claim on Facebook here and here ; and on Twitter here . But the video was previously shared in online posts that state it was filmed in South Africa -- not India. 'Incorrect information' A reverse search on Google using keyframes found the same video was uploaded on YouTube on May 23, 2021. The natural sound in this video, however, has been replaced with music. Its caption states: This clip was filmed at the #Mala_Mala_Game_Reserve in #SouthAfrica. The reserve shared the footage on Instagram in February. This video shows the pride of lions roaming in a wet area after heavy rainfall. Below is a screenshot comparison of the video in the false post (left) and the video shared on YouTube (right): A Google keyword search found the same video posted on the Instagram account of the MalaMala Game Reserve on February 13, 2021.

This is false; provincial health officials and the mall administrator told AFP that no cases are connected to the mall to date. Everyone who visited the following stores within the last 3 days needs to go to hospital or self isolate at home, warns a WhatsApp message shared in group chats and on Facebook , before listing 11 storefronts in Metrotown , a mall in a suburb of Vancouver, on Canada’s west coast.  Screenshot of a Facebook post taken on March 20, 2020 The information is false, said Jane Campbell, a spokeswoman for the British Columbia Provincial Health Services Authority , noting that no coronavirus cases in the provinces had been traced to the mall, and advising people to turn to public health authorities for COVID-19 related information. The reports regarding Metrotown Mall in Burnaby are false. The Provincial Health Officer and Minister of Health will provide any updates about confirmed cases at their daily briefings, Campbell said in an email. Merly Tan, an administrator for the mall said she was aware of the claim on social media and was critical of those perpetuating it. At this time there are no cases connected to Metrotown, she said. It’s unfortunate that individuals would do such a thing at such a time. It’s a sensitive time for everyone. The Metrotown mall reduced operating hours for two weeks starting March 16, 2020, to lower chances of contamination. Tan said the pharmacy, food vendors and a few other stores remain open for essentials. The businesses mentioned in the posts, including Nike , Foot Locker, and Aldo , have decided to close for all or portions of March. There are 271 confirmed coronavirus cases in British Columbia , and 8 people have died, the provincial health officer, Dr Bonnie Henry, announced on the afternoon of March 19, 2020. British Columbia is the province most affected by the novel coronavirus outbreak in Canada. The new death reported in the province on that day was linked to a cluster of cases at North Vancouver’s Lynn Valley Care Centre. The Public Health Agency of Canada recommends that all Canadians practice social distancing by avoiding non-essential gatherings, handshakes, crowded places, and keeping at least two arms-length from others. Travellers returning from abroad are recommended to quarantine for 14 days upon return.

65090	1.0	1.0	5.0	false	Multiple sources	2020-08-15		factcheck_afp	https://factcheck.afp.com/afp-sri-lanka	https://factcheck.afp.com/who-did-not-rank-sri-lanka-worlds-second-best-military-emergency-deployments	WHO ranked Sri Lanka the world's second best military force for emergency deployments	2020-09-14	factcheck_afp	AFP Sri Lanka	A claim that the World Health Organization has ranked the Sri Lanka Army the world’s second best military force for emergency deployments has been shared thousands of times in multiple Facebook posts. The claim is false; the WHO said there was no such ranking; the Sri Lanka Army said it only had registered for an emergency medical reponse team designation with the WHO. The claim was published on Facebook here on August 15, 2020. The post has been shared over 2,700 times. The post features an image of Sri Lankan Army Commander Lieutenant General Shavendra Silva alongside a foreign military delegation. The Sinhala caption below the photo translates to English as: The World Health Organisation has declared the Sri Lanka Army as the world’s second best military force on emergency deployments.  Screenshot of the Facebook post Similar claims were also published on Facebook here , here , here and here . The claim, however, is false. The WHO has not put out any such ranking, a WHO spokesperson for Sri Lanka told AFP in an email on September 4, 2020. The spokesperson added that the claim could be a misinterpretation of another recent achievement by the Sri Lanka Army (SLA). I think this post is in reference to the Sri Lanka Army Medical Team’s (SLAMT) registration for a type 1 fixed emergency medical team (EMT). Their registration makes them the second country in the region to apply and the second military in the world to apply. The certification will be done once the mentor completes their visits and SLAMT completes their training drills; COVID-19 travel restrictions have delayed these procedures, the spokesperson said. A spokesman for the Sri Lanka Army also refuted the claim, saying that the military has only applied to be registered as a type 1 EMT by the WHO. A reverse image search of the photo featured in the misleading Facebook post found that it bears no relevance to the WHO and in fact shows a Nigerian military delegation that visited Sri Lanka in October 2019.

AFP Fact Check debunks the main claims making the rounds. Multiple Facebook posts, like this one shared more than 1,300 times since August 1, 2020, make various claims about Microsoft founder Bill Gates, who is a regular target of conspiracy theorists because of his hefty donations to global healthcare projects over the years. The posts claim that Gates added a sterilization formula to every single vaccine for the last 10 years, an allegation that the World Health Organization purportedly admitted in court. The posts also claim that in 2017, the WHO purportedly blamed Gates for an explosion in the number of polio cases around the world.  Bill Gates is a regular target for conspiracy theorists Contacted by AFP Fact Check, the WHO rejected both claims. WHO spokesman AbdelHalim AbdAllah said the organisation was not involved in any past nor ongoing cases of that sort. Africa was declared free of wild poliovirus in August 2020, a landmark in a decades-long campaign to eradicate the disease. This historic public health achievement would have never been possible without maintaining vigilant polio disease surveillance and maintaining good vaccination coverage using the oral polio vaccine, AbdAllah said.  In August, Africa was declared free of the virus that causes polio Anti-vaccine activist AFP Fact Check found various other claims about Gates in an Instagram post by prominent anti-vaccine campaigner Robert Kennedy Jr. -- who is also the nephew of former US president John F. Kennedy. According to Kennedy's multi-slide post, Indian doctors blame Gates -- whose eponymous foundation has pledged $100 million to buy eventual Covid-19 vaccines for low-income countries -- for a polio epidemic that paralyzed 496,000 children between 2000 and 2017. However, as we explain in a previous debunk , official statistics show only a tiny number of cases in which the oral polio vaccine directly resulted in Indian children contracting the disease. India was declared polio-free in 2014 , three years after its last case of wild polio.  India was declared polio-free in 2014 There still exists a version of the illness known as vaccine-derived polio, which occurs in rare cases when the weakened virus in the vaccine mutates in areas with low vaccination coverage. According to the WHO , there were 17 cases of vaccine-derived polio in India between 2000 and 2017, with 15 in 2009 and two in 2010. It's not the first time Bill Gates has been targeted by misinformation around polio. AFP Fact Check has previously reported on social media posts accusing him of forcefully vaccinating Africans against the disease or even plotting to kill them. India kicked out Gates Foundation? Another claim made by Kennedy -- picked up by Facebook posts here and here -- is that the Indian government dialed back Gates’ vaccine regimen and evicted Gates from the country’s National Advisory Board, which advises the prime minister on policy, in 2017. As previously verified by AFP Fact Check, the Indian government rejected media reports in 2017 suggesting that health-related collaboration with the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation had been stopped. The Gates Foundation continues to collaborate and support the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, the Indian government said at the time. And in September 2019, Indian Prime Minister Narenda Modi said the Gates Foundation was doing important work in India. Gates Foundation forcibly vaccinated African children? Kennedy's post also claims that the Gates Foundation forcibly vaccinated thousands of African children against meningitis and that between 50 and 500 children developed paralysis from the MenAfriVac vaccine . Launched in 2010, the meningitis vaccine -- the first made specifically for use in Africa -- has been administered to more than 300 million people across the continent.  Conspiracy theorists accuse Gates of seeking to deliberately harm Africans through vaccination The Gates Foundation has rejected these claims. Contacted by AFP Fact Check, a spokesperson said that the foundation does not itself deliver vaccines. They said organisations such as the WHO, UNICEF and local aid groups deliver vaccines. According to the US National Institute of Health's Fogarty International Centre, the MenAfriVac programme cut cases of meningitis A from over 250,000 during an outbreak in 1996 to just 80 confirmed cases in 2015. AFP Fact Check ran a Google search for the keywords children paralysed MenAfriVac and found a report , ‘Communication Challenges During the Development and Introduction of a New Meningococcal Vaccine in Africa’, published in 2015 on the website of the US government’s National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). According to the report, a vaccination campaign in Gouro, Chad was abruptly stopped in 2015 when vaccinated children reportedly fell ill. A local journalist reported that 40 children had become severely ill -- some with paralysis -- in a news story that was promptly picked up by international media and anti-vaccine activists. Chadian authorities invited an international team of clinicians and epidemiologists to investigate the problem. An investigation proceeded; all cases were examined by physicians, who did not find cases of paralysis, and all of the affected individuals recovered without incident, the report says. The episode was determined to be 'mass psychogenic illness' — an unusual phenomenon that has been well described, the affected tending to be clusters of young girls with unusual clinical findings that gradually improve.  The MenAfriVac vaccine is the first made specifically for use in Africa Medical journal The Lancet reviewed the vaccine administration in Chad and concluded it was highly effective. Gates-funded research committed ethical violations in India? Kennedy also claims that the Gates Foundation-funded tests of experimental HPV vaccines on 23,000 girls in India committed ethical violations, and has a case before the Indian Supreme Court. AFP Fact Check found that the Gates Foundation indeed funded HPV vaccine projects for developing countries, including India. In India, seven girls died during vaccine trials, as reported in the local media and by the academic journal Science Magazine . However, further study revealed that the girls’ deaths were not vaccine-related. Five were evidently unrelated to the vaccine: One girl drowned in a quarry; another died from a snake bite; two committed suicide by ingesting pesticides; and one died from complications of malaria, Science Magazine reported. The cause of deaths for the two other girls was less certain, according to government investigators who traced all seven deaths. This was also reported by The Lancet medical journal. The trials were halted, and the Indian government set up a committee to investigate. It concluded that there were some irregularities in the administration of the vaccines. It claimed that the Gates-funded Programme for Appropriate Technology in Health (PATH) opened an office in India without getting the required mandatory approvals/permissions and exploited with impunity the loopholes in the Indian system. PATH, the global health nonprofit in charge of the vaccination process, did not agree with the conclusions of the committee. PATH is committed to meeting the highest scientific, ethical, and legal standards, the nonprofit said. Kennedy also claimed Indian government found Gates-funded researchers committed ethical violations, pressuring vulnerable village girls into the trial, bullying parents, forging consent forms, and refusing medical care to the injured girls. The claims are exaggerated; the Indian government reviewed the process and published its conclusions here . There are no records of bullying, pressuring village girls, or refusing medical care. The government, however, said the organisations in charge of the vaccinations violated some ethical standards. Criticised in South Africa? Kennedy also claims that South African newspapers said we are guinea pigs for drugmakers and that South African geopolitics professor Patrick Bond called Gates ruthless and immoral. Bond indeed criticised Gates' methods in global philanthropy in a 2016 article , but AFP Fact Check found no public record of him describing Gates as ruthless or immoral. The Times Live in South Africa did write an article to say South Africans were used as guinea pigs by drugmakers. The newspaper was reporting an allegation by Dutch NGO Wemos. There was no mention of the Gates Foundation. Gates raised polio vaccine doses to 50 per child? The Instagram post further claims that Gates took control of India's National Advisory Board (NAB) and mandated 50 polio vaccines (up from 5) to every child before age five. This is misleading. The Gates Foundation did not mandate the use of 50 polio vaccine doses for children in India. According to the WHO, the use of fractional doses, which was introduced in India in 2016, could raise the number of fractional doses in a vial to 50 -- not the number of doses to be taken by a child. When a vial intended for full-dose vaccination is used to deliver fractional doses, the number of doses it contains increases by a factor of five: a vial containing 5 or 10 full doses becomes a 25- or 50-fractional-dose vial, respectively, WHO said in one of its bulletins published in February 2019. Due to a global shortage of inactivated poliovirus vaccine, WHO’s Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization -- not the Gates Foundation -- recommended that countries with good immunisation coverage consider administering fractional doses, as they have the resources to ensure the close monitoring of patients that this method requires. According to the WHO, India was the first country in the world to introduce fractional-dose inactivated poliovirus vaccine into its immunisation programme in 2016. Gates committed $10bn to reduce world population? The post alleged that in 2010, Gates committed $10 billion to the WHO promising to reduce population, in part, through new vaccines. It added that a month later Gates told a Ted Talk that new vaccines ‘could reduce population’. It also claimed that Kenya's Catholic Doctors Association accused the WHO in 2014 of chemically sterilising millions of unwilling Kenyan women with a phony ‘tetanus’ vaccine campaign. These allegations are either false or taken out of context.  In 2010, the Gates Foundation pledged $10 billion to boost vaccination rates among children In 2010, the Gates Foundation indeed pledged $10 billion to increase vaccination rates among children. During a TED Talk in February that year, Gates spoke about reducing global population growth by 10 or 15 percent thanks to new vaccines, improved healthcare and comprehensive reproductive health services. In 2009, he recommended developing vaccines to reduce child mortality rates. He argued that increasing the chance of a child surviving to adulthood and encouraging parents to have smaller families that would benefit from government resources would create a virtuous cycle to take a country out of poverty. Gates has said that having many children can be seen by parents as a way to offset high child mortality, and that if they were sure their children would survive, they would have fewer children. The claim about sterilising Kenyan women using a tetanus vaccine has been dismissed by Kenyan authorities and the WHO. The UN health agency says the vaccine is safe . This claim has been extensively debunked by AFP Fact Check here . Malaria vaccine killed 151 Africans? Kennedy also claimed that the Gates Foundation funded a trial in 2010 of an experimental malaria vaccine by British pharmaceutical giant GlaxoSmithKline. The post says the drug killed 151 African infants and caused serious adverse effects including paralysis, seizure, and febrile convulsions to 1,048 of the 5,049 children. While the malaria vaccine was being trialled between 2009 and 2014, the WHO said the known side effects include pain and swelling at the injection site, and fever. It acknowledged that the vaccine is associated with an increased risk of febrile seizures within seven days of the administration. But in the final trial phase, known as phase three, children who had febrile seizures after vaccination recovered completely and there were no long-lasting consequences, the WHO said. There is no evidence to support Kennedy’s claims about the malaria vaccine. More about the vaccine trials can be found here and here . In Africa, misinformation portraying vaccines as harmful or even part of a plot to kill black people have fuelled a mistrust of western medical research, as AFP Fact Check investigated here . WHO vaccine killing more Africans than the diseases targeted? Citing a study by Morgensen et.al., 2017, Kennedy claims that the WHO’s Diphtheria, Tetanus and Pertussis (DTP) vaccine is killing more people than the diseases it is meant to prevent. He also says that the Gates Foundation and WHO refused to recall the vaccine. AFP Fact Check found that this claim has been around for about 20 years. Multiple studies funded and co-funded by the UN health agency in four countries do not back up the claim. All the studies show reduced mortality rates in the children vaccinated with all of the vaccines. In particular, the studies showed no negative effect of DTP vaccination, WHO said in a statement released in 2002 after the claims began making the rounds. Gates Foundation rejects claims The Gates Foundation has rejected all the above claims, stating that the foundation does not develop or manufacture vaccines. We are concerned about the conspiracy theories being spread online and the damage they could cause to public health, its spokesperson told AFP Fact Check. At a time like this, when the world is facing an unprecedented health and economic crisis, it’s distressing that there are people creating and sharing misinformation when we should all be looking for ways to collaborate and save lives. The foundation said it has never had to answer to a court case involving the WHO. While the foundation funds WHO, the spokesperson said it only funds initiatives authorised by the [194] member states that the global health body answers to.	http://164.100.47.5/newcommittee/reports/EnglishCommittees/Committee%20on%20Health%20and%20Family%20Welfare/72.pdf:-:http://hsrii.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/72.pdf:-:https://au.news.yahoo.com/polio-vaccine-crossfire-misinformation-013221898.html:-:https://au.news.yahoo.com/un-declares-africa-free-polio-171235336.html:-:https://extranet.who.int/polis/public/CaseCount.aspx:-:https://ijme.in/articles/deaths-in-a-trial-of-the-hpv-vaccine/?galley=html:-:https://perma.cc/AF3A-BBKJ:-:https://perma.cc/K49E-TZ6H?type=image:-:https://perma.cc/K7XA-PSLV?type=image:-:https://perma.cc/P2HF-4N33?type=image:-:https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28188123/:-:https://www.cdc.gov/globalhealth/immunization/infographic/meningitis_a_infographic.htm:-:https://www.counterpunch.org/2016/07/18/bill-gates-silver-bullet-misfiring-at-the-mandela-memorial-lecture/:-:https://www.fic.nih.gov/News/GlobalHealthMatters/may-june-2016/Pages/menafrivac-meningitis-vaccine.aspx#mapdescription:-:https://www.gatesfoundation.org/Media-Center/Press-Releases/2010/01/Bill-and-Melinda-Gates-Pledge-$10-Billion-in-Call-for-Decade-of-Vaccines:-:https://www.gatesfoundation.org/Media-Center/Press-Releases/2020/06/Bill-and-Melinda-Gates-Foundation-pledges-to-Gavi-the-Vaccine-Alliance:-:https://www.gatesfoundation.org/who-we-are/resources-and-media/annual-letters-list/annual-letter-2009:-:https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4639482/:-:https://www.path.org/media-center/statement-from-path-cervical-cancer-demonstration-project-in-india/:-:https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2013/09/indian-parliament-comes-down-hard-cervical-cancer-trial#:~:text=Hoping%20to%20broaden%20the%20vaccine's,Andhra%20Pradesh%20and%20Gujarat%20states.:-:https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(13)61612-8/fulltext:-:https://www.thelancet.com/pdfs/journals/lanonc/PIIS1470-2045(13)70476-5.pdf:-:https://www.timeslive.co.za/news/2013-07-25-we-are-guinea-pigs-for-the-drugmakers/#:~:text=Medical%20lab.&text=Experts%20say%20that%20the%20problem,access%20to%20medicine%20and%20treatment.:-:https://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/97/5/18-218370/en/:-:https://www.who.int/dg/speeches/2014/india-polio-free/en/:-:https://www.who.int/immunization/newsroom/press/tetanus_toxoid_vaccine/en/:-:https://www.who.int/malaria/media/malaria-vaccine-implementation-qa/en/:-:https://www.who.int/malaria/news/2020/clarifying-misperceptions-on-mvip-in-africa/en/:-:https://www.who.int/vaccine_safety/committee/topics/dtp/statement112002/en/:-:https://youtu.be/JaF-fq2Zn7I?t=276:-:https://youtu.be/dsuaUTF8xj0?t=2607	WHO did not say Bill Gates adds sterilisation formula to vaccines	['covid-19']						{'covid'}	65091	false	, , , , , , , , , , health_pred, , , , , , , , , ,

The claim is false; the WHO said it did not issue any such advisory against consuming cabbage; the US-based Centre of Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) says there is no evidence to support transmission of COVID-19 associated with food. The claim was published on Facebook here on March 23, 2020. Below is a screenshot of the misleading post: The post’s Hindi-text translates to English as: Don’t eat cabbage, according to a WHO report, the coronavirus stays in cabbage for a very long time. On usual objects, the strains last for at least 9-12 hours, whereas the strain of the virus lasts more than 30 hours on cabbage. People are advised to stay away from cabbage. The novel coronavirus, which causes the disease COVID-19, was first detected in the Chinese city of Wuhan in late 2019. As of April 1, 2020, COVID-19 has killed at least 40,598 people globally, and infected 823,626 others, according to this WHO report. A similar claim about the WHO advising against eating cabbage were also shared on Facebook here and here and on Twitter here and here . The claim is false. A WHO India representative told AFP by phone on March 30, 2020, that the agency did not issue the purported advisory.

However, there is no such employment offer from the UN health agency, which has warned the public of similar scams. The message circulating on WhatsApp chat groups in South Sudan, Kenya and Uganda claims that the advertised jobs pay $5 to $100 for two to three hours of work each day using a mobile phone. Help us fight CORONAVIRUS by working from home - no experience required... Work 2-3 hours daily on mobile and earn $5- $100 daily, the message reads.

The same claim is circulating on Facebook here , here , here and here .  Screenshot taken on July 24, 2020, of the misleading Facebook post Job offer is a scam However, the claim is false. The WHO in Uganda issued a statement on its official Facebook page on June 11, 2020, warning the public to disregard the job advert because it’s FAKE. All WHO jobs are posted on the official WHO website , it said.  Screenshot of the WHO's Facebook statement, taken on July 24, 2020 The post also misspells the WHO's name, using an s instead of a z in Organization. A search on the WHO's website also shows no mention of the so-called job advert circulating on WhatsApp and Facebook. On its cyber-security page, the organisation warns about hackers and scammers using social media and malicious online links to take advantage of people during the COVID-19 pandemic. As part of its public guidance, the WHO says it will: Never ask for your user name or password to access safety information; Never email attachments you didn’t ask for; Never charge money to apply for a job, register for a conference, or reserve a hotel; and Never conduct lotteries or offer prizes, grants, certificates, or funding through email.	http://www.who.int/:-:https://perma.cc/4VRS-6YS8?type=image:-:https://perma.cc/CP2J-Z73H?type=image:-:https://perma.cc/K442-P3WB?type=image:-:https://perma.cc/Z5GJ-EV6R?type=image:-:https://www.facebook.com/WHOUganda/posts/1416482375190542:-:https://www.who.int/about/communications/cyber-security	WHO dismisses fake COVID-19 job ads, warns of similar scams	['covid-19']						{'covid'}	65093	false	, , covid_pred, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,

However, it is not what Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus actually said, as the article itself goes on to explain: He tweeted that he was identified as a contact person of someone who had tested positive -- not that he had tested positive himself. The WHO also refuted the claim. The newspaper published the article (archived here ) on November 2, 2020, within hours of Tedros tweeting that he was self-quarantining after someone he had been in contact with tested positive for Covid-19. BREAKING: WHO DG contracts COVID-19, reads the headline of the article, which was shared across The Nation’s social media platforms, including on Facebook and Twitter .  Screenshot taken on November 2, 2020, showing the misleading headline Other news websites in Nigeria such as WithinNigeria , Oriental Times , and Republican Nigeria republished the same short article, with slightly different headlines. While these articles’ headlines all allege that Tedros was infected with Covid-19, they go on to explain that this is based on his tweet from November 1, 2020, where the 55-year-old former Ethiopian minister of health said he was identified as a contact of someone who has tested positive for #COVID19 and that he was, therefore, self-quarantining in line with WHO protocols. It is critically important that we all comply with health guidance. This is how we will break chains of #COVID19 transmission, suppress the virus, and protect health systems. 	— Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus (@DrTedros) November 1, 2020 	Nowhere in Tedros’s tweet thread or subsequent tweets does he say that he himself tested positive, nor does he say if he underwent testing. AFP reported that the WHO chief’s announcement came as there is growing anger and exasperation over new coronavirus curbs, as several European nations announced fresh lockdowns and restrictions aimed at halting rising infections and deaths. Infected person vs contact person An individual is deemed Covid-19 positive if they are tested and confirmed to have been infected. Meanwhile, a contact person refers to someone who has been in close contact with someone who has tested positive. Although it is possible that Tedros might later announce that he has been tested and found either negative or positive for Covid-19, he has not yet said anything about this as of November 2, 2020. The WHO also dismissed the reports. Contrary to some incorrect reports, @DrTedros hasn't tested positive for #COVID19, reads a WHO tweet from November 2, 2020. He has been identified as a contact of a person who tested positive. Dr Tedros is feeling well and is in self-quarantine as a precautionary measure, in line with WHO protocols.

However, the claim is false and based on a video clip that has been taken out of context. WHO still recommends infected people be quarantined and social distancing maintained. The screenshot of a tweet since removed by Twitter has been shared hundreds of times on Facebook in Canada and South Africa . BREAKING: The #WorldHealthOrganization made a complete U turn and said that #coronavirus patients doesn't need to be isolated or quarantined, reads the text in the tweet . No #SocialDistancing and it cannot even transmit from one patient to another. *See the video.* #coronascam.  Screenshots taken on July 10, 2020 of the misleading social media posts The posts share footage from a news segment on US news and talk cable channel Newsmax where reporter Greg Kelly and doctor David Samadi discussed a brief clip featuring WHO’s leading technical expert on COVID-19, Maria Van Kerkhove, speaking about the asymptomatic transmission of the virus. From the data we have, it still seems to be rare that an asymptomatic person actually transmits onwards to a secondary individual, Kerkhove said in the daily WHO press briefing recorded on June 8, 2020. Kelly and Samadi interpreted this as the WHO saying asymptomatic people cannot transmit coronavirus to others, inferring then that there is no need for social distancing and masks. I believe that the headline from the World Health Organization is ‘asymptomatic people are not infectious’, they are not going to spread the disease, said Kelly. But this is misleading. Kerkhove did not say those words and minutes before discussing asymptomatic people, she emphasised the importance of social distancing. I should remind you that masks alone will not protect you; face shields alone will not protect you for infection... We know that physical distancing works, of at least one metre. That is really paramount, it is really important that that is maintained... Kerkhove clarified her remarks about asymptomatic transmission in a question-and-answer session the next day on June 9, 2020. I was responding to a question at the press conference, I wasn’t stating a policy of WHO or anything like that, I was just trying to articulate what we know and in that, I used the phrase ‘very rare’ and I think that’s misunderstanding to state that asymptomatic transmission globally is very rare -- what I was referring to was a subset of studies, Kerkhove said. We do know that some people who are asymptomatic or some people who don’t have symptoms can transmit the virus on, she added. I was referring to some detailed investigations, cluster investigations, case contact tracing where we had reports from member states saying that when we follow asymptomatic cases, it’s very rare and I used the post ‘very rare’ that we found a secondary transmission. According to the WHO website , COVID-19 transmission occurs primarily by people already displaying symptoms or just before they develop symptoms when they are in close proximity to others for long periods of time. While someone who never develops symptoms can also pass the virus to others, it is still not clear to what extent this occurs and more research is needed in this area, the WHO says.  A u-turn? The posts claim the WHO made a complete u-turn in its guidelines for COVID-19 patients. This is wrong. It still recommends the isolation of infected people and the quarantining of their close contacts. Physical distancing is also encouraged, where possible.  A screenshot taken on July 13, 2020 from the WHO website According to the WHO , the goal of self-quarantining is to prevent transmission by keeping away from others because you have been exposed to someone with COVID-19 even though you, yourself, do not have symptoms. During self-quarantine you monitor yourself for symptoms. Self-isolation is when a person who is experiencing fever, cough or other COVID-19 symptoms stays at home and does not go to work, school or public places. The UN health authority also recommends keeping a social distance of at least one metre from others, where possible.

The claim is misleading; the World Health Organization (WHO) has warned against self-medicating for COVID-19, saying there is no current medicine that can effectively treat the disease; official guidance released by the Italian Ministry of Health about the coronavirus does not mention the purported home remedy. This Facebook post shared the claim on April 27, 2020. Below is a screenshot of the misleading post:  Screenshot of Facebook post The post states: Italy finds home remedy for Covid'19 / 500gms aspirin dissolved with lemon juice boiled with honey, it is taken hot. According to WHO data published on April 29, 2020, Italy has been among the countries worst hit by the COVID-19 pandemic, with at least 27,359 deaths and 201,505 confirmed cases. A similar claim was also shared in lengthier Facebook posts here , here , here and here . The claim is misleading. WHO does not recommend self-medication with any medicines, including antibiotics, as a prevention or cure for COVID-19, a spokesperson for WHO Philippines told AFP in an email on April 29, 2020. While some home remedies may provide comfort and alleviate symptoms of COVID-19, there is no evidence that current medicine can prevent or cure the disease. This COVID-19 guidance released by Italy’s Ministry of Health makes no reference to the purported home remedy. The ministry’s general advice for those with suspected or confirmed infections reads: The sick person must rest, drink plenty of fluids and eat nutritious food, and wear a surgical mask that needs to be changed every day. If he/she does not tolerate the mask, he/she must adopt a strict respiratory hygiene: cover his/her mouth and nose with a disposable paper tissue/handkerchief when he/she coughs or sneezes and throw it away immediately, or wash it after use, wash his/her hands with soap and water or with hydroalcoholic solution.	http://www.salute.gov.it/portale/nuovocoronavirus/dettaglioFaqNuovoCoronavirus.jsp?lingua=english&id=230#6:-:https://perma.cc/37NN-4F3X:-:https://perma.cc/7ZN8-7HV6:-:https://perma.cc/J67R-4D5G:-:https://perma.cc/JS8C-YAW9:-:https://perma.cc/LX7R-DM3A:-:https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200429-sitrep-100-covid-19.pdf?sfvrsn=bbfbf3d1_2	WHO warns against self-medicating for COVID-19 with aspirin, lemon juice and honey 'remedy'	['covid-19']						{'covid'}	65096	false	, , covid_pred, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,

That figure, an incorrect interpretation of a 2017 study, has also been cited in numerous online publications in the past two years. But the study actually states 10 rivers are the source of 88 to 95 percent of the total plastic waste transported by rivers into oceans — not the global amount of plastic present in the oceans. The meme reads: FACT - 95% of the ocean's [sic] plastic pollution comes from just ten rivers, all of which are in Asia or Africa, adding, Once again, Canada is not the problem. Don't let Justin Trudeau fool Canadians.  Screenshot taken on June 20, 2019 of a misleading Facebook post The image, which has been shared more than 4,000 times since mid-June 2019, was posted by multiple Facebook pages archived here , here and here . The claim has also been taken up in videos, including one published on the Facebook page of the World Economic Forum. The claim appears to be based on a 2017 study titled, Export of Plastic Debris by Rivers into the Sea by Christian Schmidt (et al) from the Helmholtz Centre for Environmental Research (UFZ) in Germany. Many media outlets, including The Sun , Sky News and The Times , reported on that research stating that around 90 percent of plastic waste in the world's oceans appeared to come from 10 rivers. Some publications, including The Daily Mail and The Express , have since corrected their stories to clarify that the study concerned river-borne waste and not the entire plastic load polluting the oceans. But Schmidt's study did not conclude that 10 rivers transport 88 to 95 percent of the total plastic load found in the oceans. It estimated that 88 to 95 percent of the plastic transported by 1,350 large rivers around the world — referred to by scientists as riverine waste — comes from only 10 rivers, all of which are in Asia and Africa. The study does not attempt to compare the plastic waste transported by rivers to the total plastic waste in seas and oceans. Schmidt told AFP that the estimate in the study was not for the total plastic waste in the ocean. It’s just the riverine. It does not include all the other sources that are out there, Schmidt said. Where did the confusion arise? The confusion possibly came from a press release about the study, published on October 17, 2017 on the UFZ's website that stated that UFZ researchers have also calculated that the ten river systems with the highest plastic loads (eight of them are in Asia and two in Africa) — areas in which hundreds of millions of people live, in some cases — are responsible for around 90 percent of the global input of plastic into the sea. Schmidt also recognised that a section of his paper that refers to how the 10 top-ranked rivers transport 88−95% of the global load into the sea could be misinterpreted at first glance. Schmidt said he regretted the misrepresentation of his study in a number of news articles. It's often written that 90 percent of the entire land-based plastic that ends up in the ocean comes from ten rivers. And this is not true, he said. Schmidt told AFP that the UFZ had recently contacted him after being notified of the misleading nature of the original press release. We are trying to fix that, because it should not be unclear, he said. What does the study conclude? Schmidt's study estimated the amount of plastic waste in 1,350 rivers around the world, based on previous studies of those rivers. Rivers of all sizes were included, from small first order streams to large rivers which all discharge to the sea. Schmidt and his colleagues analyzed how the polluted rivers contributed to the total plastic load transported to oceans worldwide, using two different mathematical models. The study estimated that between 0.41 and 4 million metric tons of plastic waste in oceans derives from rivers. In addition, it concluded that the 10 most polluted rivers account for 88 to 95 percent of that amount (the 0.41 to 4 million metric tons). The difference of 7 percentage points — between 88 and 95 percent — is due to the two different models used in the study. The first takes into account studies measuring only microplastic while the second includes studies on both micro- and macroplastics. Microplastics are plastic particles found in the environment that are less than five millimeters long. Macroplastics are pieces longer than five millimeters. It's hard to know exactly how much of the plastic in our oceans comes from rivers Laurent Lebreton, a researcher specialized in marine pollution, explained in a 2017 study — quoted by Schmidt in his research — that other significant sources of plastic present present in oceans include litter from beaches and discharge from the shipping and fishing industry. However, Lebreton’s most recent study , in 2019, suggests that rivers are major pathways for plastic litter to the ocean.  Screenshot taken on June 20, 2019 from the study by Schmidt et al. Calculating the exact quantity of plastic in the ocean that comes from rivers, however, is difficult, according to Schmidt. The ocean accumulates over many, many years, so it's very hard to say how much the rivers entirely contribute to the actual plastic that resides in the ocean, he told AFP.

South African users have questioned the veracity of the list, which places the small city of Pietermaritzburg second in the global ranking, along with another five South African entries in the top 20. However, the list comes from Numbeo, a website which acknowledges that its crime indices are solely based on online surveys about how safe people feel -- not objective data. One Facebook post, which we've archived here , shows the top 20 cities on the list with a caption that reads: Go SA cities earning top points on 2019 crime stats. Who would have thought PMB aka sleepy hollow was the 2nd most dangerous city in the world.? oh my.... The post has been shared some 1,800 times.  A screenshot taken on August 26, 2019 of the Facebook post More versions of the same post can be seen here and here shared hundreds of times on Facebook. Some social media users left sarcastic congratulations to South Africa for getting six cities into the top 20, while others questioned the likelihood of Pietermaritzburg, an eastern city with around 200,000 residents, being the second-most dangerous city in the world.  A screenshot taken on October 2, 2019 of comments reacting to the Facebook post  A screenshot taken on October 2, 2019 of comments reacting to the Facebook post An internet search of dangerous cities in the world numbeo.com -- the website address seen at the top of the screenshot -- shows the statistics were taken from Numbeo , a website that describes itself as the world’s largest database of user contributed data about cities and countries worldwide. Crime index levels lower than 20 are considered as very low on Numbeo, and crime levels higher than 80 are considered as being very high. However, the website also explains that its crime indices are based on surveys from visitors of this website, using survey questions it deems similar to many scientific and government surveys. AFP Fact Check in Johannesburg started a review of Pietermaritzburg to see the kind of questions asked. All of them are subjective, asking people to rate on a scale of 1-5 how worried they feel about certain issues.  A screenshot taken on October 1, 2019 of a review of Pietermaritzburg started by AFP Fact Check There are a couple of reasons to take this data with a pinch of salt. Firstly, the survey data is based on participants’ perceptions of dangers, real or imagined -- it’s possible that people responding in different places may have different ideas of what constitutes very safe or very unsafe. Secondly, a person does not need to have ever set foot in that city in order to rate how dangerous it is -- in essence, anyone from anywhere can review a city on Numbeo. The website shows that Pietermaritzburg briefly claimed the number one spot on the ranking in 2014, but has mostly ranked in second place since mid-2015. In 2018, however, the city dropped off the ranking altogether. These data are based on perceptions of visitors of this website in the past 3 years, a disclaimer reads. The city has only been reviewed by 74 people -- compared to the 353 people who contributed to Caracas, Venezuela ’s position as the most dangerous city in the world. Had the posts said Pietermaritzburg is perceived to be the world’s second-most dangerous city among more than 70,000 people to have filled in Numbeo’s surveys, they would have been accurate. Official South African crime statistics According to South Africa’s most up-to-date crime statistics released for the period from April 2018 to March 2019, the precinct with the most crime reports is Cape Town Central in the Western Cape province.  A screenshot taken on September 30, 2019 of the highest-crime South African precincts on Crime Stats SA As reported by AFP , South African soldiers have been patrolling Cape Town's crime-ridden townships since July after being deployed by the government to counter a surge of shootings, gang violence and murders. While crime in Pietermaritzburg is high, the city doesn’t feature on the list of 10 worst precincts for murder in South Africa, let alone the world. All 10 positions are occupied by cities in the Western Cape province. As noted by this local news article published on September 13, updated crime statistics indicate that Plessislaer, a southwestern suburb of Pietermaritzburg, has seen a recent spike in murders. The figures show that the Plessislaer precinct saw murders rise to 166 in the April 2018-March 2019 period, up from 104 the previous year. An overview of crimes reported in Pietermaritzburg, however, shows a minor yet consistent decline over the past five years.  A screenshot taken on October 2, 2019 of an overview of crime reports for the last five years in Pietermaritzburg on Crime Stats SA Comparing homicide rates offers a more widely accepted and objective approach to measuring how dangerous countries or cities are -- although this is heavily reliant on the assumption that statistics from each place are correct and up to date. This report on World Atlas ranked the world’s most dangerous cities on the basis of murder cases per capita, listing Los Cabos, Mexico as the most dangerous city in the world with a murder rate of 111.33 per 100,000 people. Caracas, Venezuela came second with a murder rate of 111.19, and the first South African city is ranked in 15th place -- Cape Town, with a rate of 62.25.  A screenshot taken on October 2, 2019 of 'The 50 Most Dangerous Cities' on World Atlas In South Africa, 58 people were killed each day on average last year, police said last month. The country is seeking the help of experts to understand why so many of those murders are committed by friends and relatives -- see this AFP report . A total of 21,022 people were murdered between April 2018 and March 2019 in the country, a rise of 1.4 percent over the same months between 2017 and 2018.	https://news.yahoo.com/africa-military-deployed-quell-cape-town-gang-crime-173239004.html?guccounter=1:-:https://perma.cc/97CW-TG67:-:https://perma.cc/B4MN-JV8B:-:https://perma.cc/R23P-ZU3E:-:https://www.crimestatssa.com/topten.php:-:https://www.france24.com/en/20190912-s-african-police-urge-psychologists-to-intervene-as-murders-rise:-:https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/plessislaer-is-pmbs-crime-capital-20190913:-:https://www.numbeo.com/crime/form.jsp?country=South+Africa&city=Pietermaritzburg&returnUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.numbeo.com%2Fcrime%2Fin%2FPietermaritzburg:-:https://www.numbeo.com/crime/in/Caracas:-:https://www.numbeo.com/crime/in/Pietermaritzburg:-:https://www.numbeo.com/crime/indices_explained.jsp?fbclid=IwAR3H9trIIR5EZGgamyJeU86dxKT59sg9IlBwSh5J2LKT1xdFcG1QpuLHBQ4:-:https://www.numbeo.com/crime/rankings.jsp:-:https://www.worldatlas.com/articles/most-dangerous-cities-in-the-world.html	This widely-shared ranking of the ‘world’s most dangerous cities’ is based solely on a survey of how safe people feel								65098	false	, , , crime_pred, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , 
65099	2.0	1.0	5.0	false	Multiple sources	2018-07-05		factcheck_afp	https://factcheck.afp.com/mary-kulundu:-:https://factcheck.afp.com/afp-kenya:-:https://factcheck.afp.com/afp-brazil	https://factcheck.afp.com/wildlife-photographers-frustration-false-story-circulating-alongside-her-award-winning-picture	Photo of mother deer sacrificing herself to save her babies	2019-07-24	factcheck_afp	Mary Kulundu:-:AFP Kenya:-:AFP Brazil	A picture of a helpless antelope surrounded by three bloodthirsty and hungry cheetahs has been widely shared, in various languages, alongside claims that it shows a deer who sacrificed her life to save her fawns. The posts further claim that witnessing the scene pushed the photographer into depression. However, Alison Buttigieg, the photographer behind the lens, told AFP that there was no truth at all to this story. She expressed frustration that the false story is still circulating, even though she spoke out to set the record straight years ago. One of the posts, which we’ve archived here , has been shared more than 1,500 times since it was published on Facebook on July 5, 2018. Among the 1,800 comments, many readers appeared moved by the story of a mother’s unconditional love. This photo won the award for best photo of the decade and led the photographer into depression. The cheetahs chased a mother deer and her two fawns (baby deer). The mother could have easily out run cheetahs but instead she offered herself to cheetahs so her young ones could manage to run to safety. In this picture she is seen looking at her babies running safely as she is about to be torn to pieces??...There is no unconditional love like a mother's love,there's no tender care than a mother's care and there's no one in this world who sacrifices more than a mother do... the caption reads.  A Facebook post sharing a false story about a photo taken by Alison Buttigieg, as seen in a screenshot taken on July 23, 2019 The same story has been shared in numerous posts in various languages, including Portuguese and Spanish . We’ve archived other posts in English sharing the false story here and here . A reverse image search using the online tool TinEye located the image on this blog owned by Alison Buttigieg, a Maltese wildlife photographer based in Finland. Buttigieg told AFP via email that the social media posts were inaccurate, adding that it was frustrating that despite clarifying what was happening in the picture years ago, the misleading version of the story seems to be what attracts online users. She took the picture in September 2013 at the Maasai Mara national reserve in Kenya. This photo has now been viral for over 2.5 years -- always with the same fake story, said Buttigieg, who had set the record straight in a February 2017 Facebook post . Despite clarifying many times what is the true story, people prefer to spread the fake version -- as it’s sensational and gets a lot of ‘likes’. As a wildlife conservation photographer this is irritating because I strive to spread factually correct information about animal behaviour, she said. Buttigieg expressed disgust at how mental illness was being used to spread a false narrative. The depression part -- I have no words for that. To use a fake mental illness statement to make a story more viral is insensitive to me (it caused me problems in my workplace) as well as the people suffering from this disease. She is also frustrated that social media posts are sharing her image without permission. The watermark that originally appeared in the top right-hand corner of the photograph, identifying it as her work, has been cropped out in the version that has been shared alongside the false stories.  On Alison Buttigieg's blog, the photograph appears with a watermark identifying it as her work Because images are so easily shared on the internet, professional photographers like Buttigieg often mark their work with their name or website address. This means that their work can at least be recognised as theirs, even when the image is shared -- as is so often the case -- without their permission. In this case, however, Buttigieg is not even being credited as the person who took the picture. It is disturbing that this day and age misinformation spreads faster than facts and people feel free to steal images, embellishing them with false stories and share them. I have been harassed by some of these pages when I dared to report them to have the image taken down, she told AFP. Buttigieg gave us permission to use her image for this fact-check. The wildlife photographer directed AFP to her blog , where in a series of nine pictures, she explains how a mother cheetah was teaching her young ones to hunt down an impala. An impala is a type of antelope found in eastern and southern Africa. It’s not a deer, despite being described as such in the false social media posts. I witnessed this Cheetah kill in September 2013 in the Maasai Mara, Kenya. Narasha, the cheetah mom, was teaching her youngsters how to kill prey. However they were a bit slow on the uptake and they were playing with the hapless Impala prey instead of killing it. Narasha, the cheetah mom is the one that is grabbing the impala by the neck in all the photos, the first paragraph of the blog reads. There is no mention of the impala sacrificing herself to save her babies -- this narrative was invented. While it’s also not true that the image won the prize for best photo of the decade, it did earn Buttigieg an award. As mentioned on her blog , she won a prize for the photograph at the Siena International Photo Awards in November 2016.	http://www.alisonbuttigieg.com/cheetahkill/:-:https://perma.cc/3RBE-NQ7G:-:https://perma.cc/5YJK-L7EA:-:https://perma.cc/7KSN-NXLT:-:https://perma.cc/PQB3-M298:-:https://perma.cc/ZG5G-3EGS:-:https://www.alisonbuttigieg.com/2016/11/18/remarkable-award-in-the-siena-international-photo-awards/:-:https://www.facebook.com/gepardi/posts/10212438608579521	A wildlife photographer’s frustration at the false story circulating alongside her award-winning picture								65099	false	, , , , , , , environment & climate_pred, , , , , , , , , , , , , 
65100	2.0	1.0	5.0	false	The Daily Wire	2020-11-08		factcheck_afp	https://factcheck.afp.com/afp-usa:-:https://factcheck.afp.com/ian-timberlake	https://factcheck.afp.com/wisconsin-poll-clerks-did-not-illegally-add-witness-addresses-mail-ballots	Wisconsin clerks may have illegally filled in witness address on ballots	2020-11-10	factcheck_afp	AFP USA:-:Ian Timberlake	Articles shared tens of thousands of times on social media claim Wisconsin, a state crucial to president-elect Joe Biden’s victory, may have broken the law by allowing poll clerks to fill in missing witness addresses on absentee ballots. This is false; the state’s elections commission says the practice applied to witness certifications -- not the ballots themselves -- and poll clerks have been allowed to add the addresses since 2016 under a policy Republicans endorsed. Wisconsin Election Commission Might Have Violated State Law by Allowing Clerks to ‘Fix’ Ballots, Report says, a November 8, 2020 article in conservative media outlet The Daily Wire claimed.  Screenshot of a Facebook post, taken November 9, 2020 The article, which was posted on Facebook by Daily Wire co-founder Ben Shapiro, came as President Donald Trump refuses to concede and contends without evidence that the election was stolen. In its claim, The Daily Wire refers to Wisconsin Statute 6.87 6(d) , which states that if the witness certificate accompanying an absentee ballot is missing the witness’s address, then the ballot may not be counted. The article continues that, in October 2020, the state Elections Commission issued a directive that seemed to allow clerks to ‘fix’ ballots. Similar claims appeared on the Just the News website and were made by conservative podcaster Dan O’Donnell , whose article was retweeted by Trump’s son Eric.  Screenshot of a retweet from Eric Trump, taken November 10, 2020 There were no corrections made to ‘ballots,’ Reid Magney , public information officer for the Wisconsin Elections Commission, said in a statement emailed to AFP. These were witness addresses added, in accordance with the Commission directive, to the certificate , which is on the ballot envelope and must include signatures of the voter and witness, as well as the witness’s address, he said.  Screenshot of an example of a Wisconsin absentee ballot certificate, taken November 9, 2020 The addresses were added as part of a publicly observable process and under Commission guidance in effect since October 2016. The statement added that the motion to approve the guidance was made by Republican members of the Commission four years ago. It passed unanimously and has been in effect for 11 statewide elections, including the 2016 presidential and presidential recount. No one has objected to it until now, the Commission statement said, adding that the October directive, cited by The Daily Wire, was simply a restatement of the earlier guidance. An absentee ballot cannot be counted without a witness, and the law does not specify who affixes the address, the Commission said. According to the guidance, a clerk can use reliable information (personal knowledge, voter registration information, through a phone call with the voter or witness) to resolve missing witness address information. Details on how the state ensures the accuracy of its votes can be seen here. US media on November 4 projected Biden as the winner of the 10 electoral college votes in Wisconsin, where Trump was victorious in 2016. He has demanded a recount in the state.
